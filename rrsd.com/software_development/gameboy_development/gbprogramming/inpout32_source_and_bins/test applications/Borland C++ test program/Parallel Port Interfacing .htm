<H3>Parallel port interfacing in Win32</H3>In the newer versions of 
Windows<SUP>(R)</SUP> I was left wondering how, if at all, I could read and 
write my parallel port. Even Borland had dropped support for direct I/O to the 
hardware. 
<P>But now there's inpout32.dll -- which works on Win98SE, Win2K and WinXP. This 
DLL provides hardware I/O to your computer's parallel port. 
<P>Using Borland's Free C++ Command-line Compiler, I wrote a test program which 
demostrates I/O to a printer port using inpout32.DLL -- Now you can do port I/O 
directly from a C program, and compile everything in a DOS console. 
<P>

  <LI>The test program builds with Borland's Command-line C Compiler, which is 
  free for public download from Borland.com, at <A

  <LI>Also, get the book, ''Parallel Port Complete,'' all about parallel port 
  interfacing, and program examples that work with Inpout32.dll from <A

<P>Please let me know what you discover, and if it also works with other I/O 
devices too (I haven't checked if it does yet...)
