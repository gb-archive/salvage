</p><h2 id="General_Description">General Description</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-18"></span><p class="line867"><em><strong>Assembly Language Programming for Engineers</strong></em> uses the Z80 microprocessor and the GameBoy platform to introduce general concepts of computer architecture, machine and assembly language programming. The course is a mix of theory and application: students will learn general ideas of how assembly language code is constructed, independent of the microprocessor. They will practice these ideas and concepts with programming projects on the GameBoy. <span class="anchor" id="line-19"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-20"></span></p><p class="line867">
</p><h2 id="Teaching_Philosophy">Teaching Philosophy</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span><p class="line862">Most classes taught at major universities follow a model of teaching in which the teacher imparts information to the students and then tests the students to see how well they have retained the information presented to them. This pedagogical approach, called <em>Instructionism</em>, focuses on the teacher as the giver of information. In contrast, <em>Constructionism</em> is a learner and community-based model. As the wikipedia puts it, "Constructionist learning involves students drawing their own conclusions through creative experimentation and the making of social objects. The constructionist teacher takes on a mediational role rather than adopting an instructionist position. Front of class teaching 'at' students is replaced by assisting them to understand&mdash;and help one another to understand&mdash;problems in a hands-on way." <span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span></p><p class="line862">While it is not practical for <em>Assembly Language Programming for Engineers</em> to be designed from the Constructionist model, I am inspired by the ideas of Constructionist educators such as Seymour Papert, Mitchel Resnick, and David Cavallo. I try to borrow from the Constructionist model as I can: <span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span></p><ul><li>students will rarely find their assignments completely spelled out. Intentionally, there will be room for personal exploration. <span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span></li><li>emphasis will be placed on the class as a community which communicates and supports itself within the context of the material presented. <span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span></li><li>discussion and conversation is emphasized on all levels between and among teachers and students <span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span></li><li>the standard hierarchical model of teacher and student is loosened: <span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span><ul><li>students can and should expect to learn from each other as much as from the teachers <span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span></li><li>teachers can and should expect to learn from students and other teachers <span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span></li><li>conversations between and among teachers and students is open and indeed part of the learning that occurs in the course. <span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span></li></ul></li><li>the course material is treated as continually changing, developing, and influenced by the class community, rather than as fixed facts to be presented within a formal structure.    <span class="anchor" id="line-33"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-34"></span></li></ul><p class="line867"><em>Assembly Language Programming for Engineers</em>, in exploring how to enhance the framework of Instructionism, is an experiment to better understand what teaching models can work within the University now and in the future. We welcome your feedback on this experiment throughout and at the end of the course.  <span class="anchor" id="line-35"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-36"></span></p><p class="line867">

<span class="anchor" id="line-69"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-70"></span><p class="line874">For their term project, students in the course will write an interactive application appropriate for youth. This might be a game, a drawing program, a construction kit for story telling, or anything you can imagine that is practical within the time limits of the course. Toward the end of the semester, we will show our term projects to pre-teenagers, have them try out our software, and maybe tell them a bit about how we wrote it, if they are interested. <span class="anchor" id="line-71"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-72"></span></p><p class="line862">Throughout the semester, students will submit assignments helping them learn the skills they need to write their term project. There will be one midterm which will be "old school:" in-class, open-book, pencil and paper. In the midterm you be will introduced to a microprocessor we have <em>not</em> studied and be asked to explain basic architecture and write simple routines using this new microprocessor.   <span class="anchor" id="line-73"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-74"></span></p><p class="line867">
</p><h2 id="Format">Format</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-75"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-76"></span><p class="line874">I am a strong believer that one of the main roles of any University is to share its knowledge freely and openly. For this reason, all content for the course, with the exception of your grades, will be on kept on publically viewable sites which can be contributed to collaboratively. This has the added benefit of giving us practice communicating and sharing information for the betterment of the class community. Specifically we will use: <span class="anchor" id="line-77"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-78"></span></p><p class="line867">
</p><h3 id="Class_wiki">Class wiki</h3>
<span class="anchor" id="line-79"></span><p class="line862">A wiki is a type of website that allows users to easily add and edit content and is especially suited for collaborative writing. Most of the reference and course material for <em>Assembly Language Programming for Engineers</em> is set up on the class wiki, meaning that any student in the class can change the site, adding or clarifying material. Students are encouraged to continually add to the class wiki as a contribution to the entire class. For example, if a student finds a great resource for surplus GameBoys and it is not listed on the wiki, that student might add it. If installation instructions for a particular piece of software are incorrect or missing information, the student might also correct this information to the wiki. <span class="anchor" id="line-80"></span>
</p><h3 id="Blog">Blog</h3>
<span class="anchor" id="line-81"></span><p class="line862">Use <a class="http_wayback" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090606133145/http://cratel.wichita.edu/blogs/Assembly08">the class blog</a> to submit all class assignments. In addition, you are encouraged to post to the course blog freely, using it as an engineer's sketchbook. Each week, you could document on your this blog your process in completing the projects or assignments you did, thoughts the assignments inspired for you, and any difficulties, tips, or tricks you might suggest for yourself and others. <span class="anchor" id="line-82"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-83"></span></p><p class="line867">

<span class="anchor" id="line-84"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-85"></span><ul><li>All students in the class, as well as guest lecturers and other special guests, will subscribe to the course electronic mailing list. All members of the list will be able to post to it simply by writing an email to the list. <span class="anchor" id="line-86"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-87"></span></li><li class="gap">Students will use the electronic mailing list as a way to share assignments, ask questions, seek help, or just share information pertaining to or of interest to the class. For example, many weekly assignments may be emailed into the email list/forum as well as posted onto the course blog. Resources will also be shared on the electronic mailing list, as well as posted to the wiki. <span class="anchor" id="line-88"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-89"></span></li><li class="gap"><p class="line891"><strong>When faced with a problem in the class, instead of contacting the instructor, send an email to the electronic mailing list.</strong> This allows the class as a community to act as a resource for help. <span class="anchor" id="line-90"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-91"></span></p></li><li class="gap">In addition to sharing assignments and ideas, students are strongly encouraged to respond to each other's assignments, projects and ideas through free discussion on the mailing list. <span class="anchor" id="line-92"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-93"></span></li></ul><p class="line867">

<span class="anchor" id="line-118"></span><p class="line862">I have chosen the GameBoy as our programming platform because it is simple enough that we can create interesting code within its framework in one semester.
