 GB Basic is a floating-point BASIC interpreter for GameBoy that
allows you to write & execute programs up to 7.4K bytes in size.
If it is used in a cart with RAM then a program can be SAVEd and
LOADed at a later time.

 Currently string variables are not supported, but may be in the
future.

 Long variable names are not supported. Variable names may be
a letter or a letter and a number.

 Each line requires a line number.

 &H may be used for entering hex values. (Ex: POKE &HFF00,&HFF)

The following commands are supported:

ABS(x)           -       Return the absolute value of x.

AUTO             -       Enable Auto load & run program on reset.
                         (Note: Use AUTO command last since SAVE
                          disables auto mode.)

CLEAR            -       Clear all variables.

                         to XOR on program execution.)

COS(x)           -       Return the cosine of x given in radians.

DIM              -       Only single dimension arrays are currently
                         supported. If not explicitly defined by a
                         DIM statement, it is assumed to be a size
                         of 10 upon first reference.

DATA x,...       -       Data in program.

INT(x)           -       Returns the integer of x.

KEYPAD(x)        -       If x=0, the following bits are returned
                         if that button is pressed.
                           128 - Start    8 - Down
                            64 - Select   4 - Up

                         If x>0, then x is ANDed with the bits
                         above. If the result = zero, 0 is returned.
                         If result <> zero, a 1 is returned.

                          Gameboy must be reset or power must be cycled
                         for changes to take effect. The last setting is
                         saved in battery backed RAM. (External terminal
                         won't currently work when SERVOs are enabled
                         because of interrupt conflicts.)

                         Lowering this value reserves memory for
                         USR for example. NOTE: All variables are
                         CLEARed when this instruction is executed.

NEW              -       Erase all program lines in memory.

POINT x,y        -       Draw a point on the screen using COLOR.
                         (0<=x<=127,0<=y<=119)

REM              -       Remark. Also ' is supported.

RENUM            -       Renumber program.

RESTORE          -       Set DATA pointer to a specific line number. If
                         no line number present, beginning of program.

RETURN           -       Return from subroutine.

RND(x)           -       Returns a random number between 0 and 1.
                         x is ignored.

RUN              -       Execute program.

SAVE             -       Save program to battery-backed RAM.

SCREEN x         -       If x=0, set text mode. If x=1, set graphics mode.

SERVO x,y        -       Controls the position of up to 8 memory-mapped
                         servos. SERVO 0,a defines the memory address of
                         the servos output port and enables the servo
                         interrupt routine. SERVO x,y outputs a high
                         pulse to servo x for 693+(y*7.6) microseconds
                         giving a pulse range of .7 to 2.3 ms. A value of
                         y = 0 disables the output pulse of that servo.
                         This pulse is sent out every 20 ms. Servos may be
                         set before issuing SERVO 0,a to enable them. On
                         reset, servos default to off (y=0) and disabled.
                         NOTE: When enabled, servos slow down system about
                         15% due to servo interrupt servicing. Use SERVO 0,0
                         to disable all servos once they have been enabled.

Revision History
----------------

V1.0  - Original release
V1.01 - Rearranged on-screen keyboard.
        Reassigned key controls.
        Fixed exponent display problem.
V1.02 - Completed RENUM routine.
        Added restore [line#] ability.
        Added hex entry of numbers using prefix &h.
V1.03 - Fixed 'cursor disappear' when arrow buttons pressed.
        Greatly speeded up CLS command.
        Added SCREEN, POINT, & LINE routines.
        Break now works for lines that GOTO themselves.
        Rearranged on-screen keyboard again for faster entry.
V1.04 - Select & Start are BOTH now required to break.
        This was done to allow individual buttons to be pressed
        and read with the new KEYPAD command.
        Added COLOR command.
V1.05 - Added AUTO command.
        Credit screen disappears after 10 seconds.
V1.06 - Fixed bugs in LIST options. Up & down buttons now
        speed up or slow down LIST command. Pressing break
        now halts LIST command.
        Added SOUND command.
V1.07 - Added SERVO command.
        Changed DELAY increments from 1ms to 10ms
         in order to implement SERVO command.
        Select Button is now a caps lock.
        Credit screen now disappears after 4 seconds.
        Carat symbol added to onscreen menu.
        FOR,GOTO,INPUT,LIST,NEXT,PRINT,RUN & THEN
         now can be entered by first letter followed by period.
V1.08 - Shift & Caps Lock now supported on external keyboard.
        CLS now redraws onscreen menu properly in text mode.
        Basic commands can now be entered in lower or upper case.
        DELAY added to 'first letter' list above.
V1.10 - Fixed bug that would randomly display line numbers
         incorrectly.
        Game link port now supports external terminal I/O.
        Added LINK command to configure game link port.
        V1.08 didn't work on VGB. Haven't figured out why yet.
V1.20 - MAJOR BUG FIXES.
        Added better handshaking to link port for reliable
         file download using GB Terminal.
        Fixed bug in floating point conversion that would
         randomly mess up many functions due to interrupts.
        Writing to screen is now much more reliable with no
         more random trash displayed on screen.
        SERVO 0,0 now disables all servo output pulses.
        Added MEMTOP, REGBC, REGDE, & USR commands.
V1.21   Individual servos pulses may now be turned off by
        issuing SERVO x,0. On many servos this lowers battery
        drain when they're not in use.
V1.22   Swapped command/button positions on intro screen.
         Suggestted by David Nathan.
        Fixed bug where SOUND < 256 duration would
         play continuously. Reported by John Montalbano.
        Fixed error messages for DIM that were not
         correct. Reported by Oliver Wittchow.
        Entry of "2g.1" caused software lockup.
         Reported by Marc Rawer.
V2.00   Initial support for GB Colo(u)r.
        Commands SLOW & FAST added to allow changing
         between single & double speed modes on the GBC.
V2.10   Replaced FAST & SLOW with SPEED 0 & SPEED 1 to
         conserve reserved keyword space.
        Replaced REGBC x & REGDE y with REG x,y to
         conserve reserved keyword space.
        Added SINIT & SOUT for RS232 serial & digital output
         on Nintendo MBC spare digital output pins.
