<DT><STRONG><A NAME="Software">What software do I need to get started in GB
development ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>First, you need to get an Assembly Language (ASM) compiler (often also
referred to as an assembler) or GBDK compiler if you wish to program in C
language instead of ASM.<BR><BR>Next, if you are programming in ASM you need
to get a conversion program that will convert the output of the assembler into a
format that is useable by the GB. (<A HREF="#ImportantWebLinks">RGBFIX</A> is a
popular DOS program that many use to do this conversion.) A conversion program
does such things as fix the ROM checksums &amp; pad the ROM file to a correct
size.<BR><BR>To test your program you will either need a <A HREF="#Emulator">gb
emulator</A> or a <A HREF="#FlashCart">flash cart.</A><BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="Hardware">What hardware do I need to get started in GB
development ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Theoretically you can use a <A HREF="#Emulator">gb emulator</A> for
development and not require any hardware. The reality though is that no emulator
is 100% like the real GB hardware and emulators will often run code that real
hardware will not.<BR><BR>To guarantee that your code will run on real GB
hardware you need to put your code into a GB cart and try it on the real GB
handheld unit. To do this you can wire an EPROM into a GB cart (yourself) or buy
or build a <A HREF="#FlashCart">flash cart</A>. EPROM's require an ultraviolet
light source to erase them so flash carts are often a simpler solution.<BR><BR>Another
method that some use is to connect an <A HREF="#Emulator">EPROM emulator</A> to
a GB cart. <BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="Docs">Where can I find programming specification
documents?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Check the <A HREF="#ImportantWebLinks">Important Web Links</A>
section.<BR><BR>The best document (arguably) for GBC development information
is the abc409 document. Any information that you can not locate on the GBC is
usually always exactly the same as information for the older GB series. As a
result, use the document described next as a GBC reference as well.<BR><BR>The
best document for GB development is the updated Pan/kOOPa document (otherwise
known as the GB Manual.)<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="CorASM">Which is better C or Assembly Language (ASM) for
development ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Assembly language is what the majority of commercial GB games use. One
reason for this is that no serious C compiler has been available for the GB
until GBDK was released. Another reason is that C is terribly inefficient. A C
compiler can often generate 8 to 10 times more code compared to optimized
assembly code. As GB ROM cart sizes get larger this makes less of a difference
unless you are talking about ROM bank 0. ROM bank 0 is a major bottle neck for
many commercial games. Some code must reside in ROM bank 0. Often the amount of
code that must reside in ROM bank 0 is larger than a person expects until he
gets deep into a large project. Commercial GB programmers often have a hard time
fitting all the code required in ROM bank 0 when using highly optimised assembly
code so using C provides even more of a challenge.<BR>Assembly code that uses
the HALT command can save up to 5% battery power compared to a similar program
written in GBDK even if the GBDK program uses HALT as well. The reason for more
power being required is due to the larger code generated by GBDK thus causing
the CPU to stay awake longer each game loop.<BR><BR>C for use in commercial
applications is becoming more popular. It often requires less of a learning
curve for development for those that already know C fairly well. With many key
subroutines written in assembly language and called from C, many of the issues
of code size &amp; execution speed start to disappear. It's also an excellent
means for porting C code from another platform to the GB. <BR><BR>To be able
to do many special effects you will probably need to learn assembly enough to at
least code time-critical interrupts &amp; other code.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="Tutorials">Are there any tutorials for writing software

<DD><BR>Check every page on the GB Dev web ring first. Many good sources of
info can be found on the ring.<BR><BR>If you are programming in C using GBDK
check out the GBDoK tutorial. Also check out the

Language Primer (GALP) v1.0 on a web page on the GB dev web ring.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="FlashCart">What is a flash cart &amp; do I need one ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Flash carts allow you to test your custom GB code on a GB. You can
also use them to play commercial GB ROMs that you might obtain from the internet
but this is illegal. Especially if the commercial ROM is still available for
sale.<BR><BR>Flash carts are more ideal for testing custom code than
<A HREF="#Emulator">gb emulators</A> because emulators often allow you to do
things that real GB hardware does not allow due to hardware limitations.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="FlashCart">Where can I get a commercial flash cart ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>There is currently only one place that publically sells flash carts
and that is Bung Enterprises Limited. Nintendo sells a 32mbit flash cart (one
with &amp; one without rumble support) but this is only available for sale to
licensed developers. The Super Smart Card made by China Coach Limited is no
longer available and the company itself is out of business. The C3 cart made by

ISAS is short for <A HREF="http://www.intsys.co.jp/">Intelligent Systems</A>
ASsembler.<BR><BR>  However, this assembler isn't required for official
development. Some official developers use RGBDS, TASM, and probably GBDK as
well.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="ProHardware">What hardware tools do official developers
use ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>  The <A HREF="http://www.intsys.co.jp/">Intelligent Systems</A>
Debugger (US$4000) or Emulator (US$3000) are the most common hardware
development  tools. They connect to the SCSI port of an IBM-PC and allow
downloading 8mbit files in just a few seconds to a GB or GBC. They both support
development for projects as large as 64mbits. A special cart with a cable
connecting the cart to the ISAS hardware  is used to allow running the
downloaded program on a GB. Both of these units also allow programming Nintendo
flash carts. (These flash carts are only available to licensed developers as
well.)<BR><BR>  Other official developers use a
<A HREF="#Emulator">gb emulator</A> program that runs on an IBM-PC to do most
testing and occasionally test their programs on the real GB hardware by using a
<A HREF="#FlashCart">flash cart</A>.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="GBandGBC">What are .GB and .GBC files ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>These files are raw ROM files. There is no header or trailer
information in these files. This is the exact data that is contained in cart
ROMs. Also, this is the file format required by Bung <A HREF="#FlashCart">flash
carts</A>.<BR><BR>The .GB indicates that the rom contains GB but no GBC code.
The .GBC indicates that the ROM supports GB &amp; GBC or GBC only.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="ISX">What are .ISX files ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>These are compact ROM files that are generated by the ISAS assembler.
They must be converted to .GB/.GBC format before they can be programmed to most
flash carts and all GB emulators.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="ISX2GB">How do I convert .ISX files to .GB/.GBC files ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>To convert a .ISX file to a .GB file go to the
<A HREF="http://www.intsys.co.jp/tool/cgb/sdk/">Intelligent Systems ISAS/ISLK</A>
web page and download CVTISX and then do the following steps in DOS (Check here

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="ISDongle">Are some of the files on Intelligent Systems

<DD><BR>No. You have to have the SCSI interface Emulator or Debugger that

use some of the files.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="GBCFeatures">What capabilities are specific to the GBC ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>The GBC is basically a GB with these extra features:<BR><BR>*
Colo(u)r capability including 8 sprite palettes &amp; 8 background palettes<BR><BR>*
Background tile attributes which include X/Y flipping<BR><BR>* Twice as much
video RAM (16K) &amp; four times more main RAM (32K)<BR><BR>* InfraRed (IR)
send / receive interface<BR><BR>* Two new DMA modes for more powerful graphics
capabilities<BR><BR>* Single-speed (same as GB) or double-speed CPU clock mode<BR><BR>*
Link port pin 4 is an unrestricted digital input<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="MBC">What is an MBC, when is one needed, and what are
the differences between them ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>An MBC is a Memory Bank Controller. It is required any time time you
have more than 32k bytes (256kbits) of cart ROM or more than 8k bytes (64kbits)
of cart RAM because the GB &amp; GBC can only access up to this amount of cart
ROM &amp; RAM at any one time. <BR><BR>Here are brief descriptions of each
MBC. Listed values are the maximum supported ROM &amp; RAM. Many/most carts do
not use the maximum ROM &amp; RAM that the MBC type is capable of supporting.
For the complete &amp; most accurate differences check <A HREF="#Docs">here</A>:<BR><BR>MBC1
- 2M bytes ROM/8k bytes RAM -or- 512k bytes ROM/32k bytes RAM<BR>MBC2 - 256k
bytes ROM/512 nybbles RAM (nybble = 4 bits)<BR>MBC3 - 32M bytes ROM/32k bytes
RAM, Real Time Clock support (not available in all MBC3 carts)<BR>MBC5 - 64M
bytes ROM/128K bytes RAM (First MBC guaranteed to handle GBC double speed mode.
Other MBCs handle double speed even though there is no guarantee.)<BR>HuC1 - An
MBC similar to MBC1 but with InfraRed (IR) transmit &amp; receive capability.<BR>TAMA5
- This is a special MBC that Bandai put out for for Tamagotchi 3 (Japanese).
This is the only cart capable of making simple sounds while the GB itself is
turned off.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="Developer">How do I become a licensed GB developer ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR> This usually requires that you submit samples of your work to
Nintendo. Often this even means submitting a game that is nearly complete in
order that Nintendo might better realize your potential for code, graphics, &amp;
sound. Without them having something to see there is no real incentive for them
to seriously listen to your objectives. But that's just one opinion....<BR><BR>Check

internet so that I can play Pokemon with a friend ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>No one has yet proven whether this is possible.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="Default">Why is it that most older GB games when run on 
a GBC have blue &amp; green backgrounds with red sprites but a few games have
different default colo(u)rs ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>The GBC has a built-in list of older GB games for which it has default
colo(u)rs. If the internal cart name matches up with any of the names in the GBC
built-in list then these custom colo(u)rs are used instead of the default
colo(u)rs.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="IRCChannel">Is there an IRC channel for GB development ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Yes. Channels #gbdev, #gameboy, and #pocketdev on efnet. Many have
been abandoning #gbdev, though, due to the number of bots in that channel.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="RomHeader">What is the ROM header info in ROMs used for
?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>The Nintendo graphic area &amp; the complement byte are the only
things that the GB Classic &amp; GB Pocket care about and check. These bytes
must be set correctly or a game will lockup after scrolling the Nintendo power
up logo.<BR><BR>On the Super GB, rom addresses $146 &amp; $14b must be set
correctly for SGB features to work.<BR><BR>On the GBC, rom address $143 must
be set correctly for GBC features to work.<BR><BR>Nintendo has a special piece
of equipment that they use to test returned carts. It reads the ROM size, RAM
size, MBC type, Checksum, and other information in order to know what hardware
is present for testing. This is the reason for the other data fields in the ROM
header area. This information is not used by games themselves.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="LCDProb">What can you do if some of the lines of the LCD
display quit working ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Many early GameBoy Classic units had LCD display driver chips that
would go bad over time. The solution would be to replace the bad chip or get a
new GB. Replacing the chip is beyond the scope of these FAQs.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="SellCarts">Do you have to be licensed by Nintendo to

<DD><BR>It is not necessary to be an official Nintendo publisher to sell
Gameboy format games. <A HREF="http://www.christianlink.com/media/wisdom/">Wisdom

before. However, they won the case and is currently selling Gameboy format
software without license from Nintendo.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="GBC2">Is there really going to be a GBC2 next generation
handheld ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Yes, according to NCL (Nintendo of Japan). A next generation GBC is in
development.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="GBCBugs">What games written for GB will not work

- See &quot;<A HREF="#GBBugs">Are there any undocumented bugs in the GB ?</A>&quot;.<BR><BR><STRONG>Rtype</STRONG>
- The GBC sets sound wave RAM to a square wave on power up (even in GB mode)
while the GB had random data in the wave RAM that &quot;tended&quot; to be the
same values (but not always) on power up. Rtype never specifically sets wave RAM
to known values so as a result some sounds in this game sound different. (Info
from Martin Korth.)<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="SellGame">How do I go about trying to sell my game/demo
to a company ?
</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR> (The following information is very subjective and should be treated
as such.)<BR><BR>From a collective feedback from many people it appears that
it takes a special publisher to publish an original work. Many publishers don't
want original work but rather would prefer to tell you what to port from an
Arcade,N64,PC,PSX, or motion picture to GBC.<BR> One reason might be that few
people want to take responsibility if an original title does not do well. If a
game that is ported to GBC doesn't sell well then they can say &quot;That's
strange, the version for XYZ sold well so this one should have done well in
sales.&quot; If an original game doesn't sell well there is always some guy in
the company (if the company is large enough) that will say &quot;told you so, I
thought it was a dumb idea.&quot;<BR>Another reason might be that no one has
heard of original titles and so they are less likely to buy it on the shelves. I
know there have been cases where parents have come up to me in stores and asked
me what they should buy for their kid even though they don't know me. It seems
that very often people want to surprise their kids or their relatives kids with
a game rather then ask them what they want. They often pick any game title they
recognize. The recognition is often due to the fact that the game is a
conversion from another game or a movie.<BR><BR>   On the other hand, if you
have already done some GBC titles then some companies are willing to sit down
and discuss your original ideas once they have some confidence in your proven
programming ability, project reliability, and demonstrated speed.<BR><BR>If
you have never done work for the company you are talking with, your game often
must be complete (or 99.9% anyway) before they can make any decisions on whether
to publish it or not. (On incomplete games they have no idea what sound or
graphics that you might add later that they might find offensive or annoying so
it's rare to get any decisions until a game is complete or until they have
experience working with you.)<BR><BR> Don't expect people that don't know you
extremely well to hand out email addresses or other contact information to
companies. No one wants to get an email that says, &quot;Why did you refer this
guy to me? He has minimal talent and he harasses me contantly with ROMs by
email!&quot; To get games to the right people you generally have to go to large
game industry shows and meet as many people as you can. You need to take your
completed game with you to the show. Make appointments with every GBC publisher
at the show if possible. If the game looks promising and is &quot;flashy&quot;
that might get them to look at it. If the game is good and has depth then that
might even get them to publish it.<BR><BR>A game that you have done yourself
needs to look atleast as good as the average GBC game available. Often it has to
look better or do something unique that no other game does to keep a publishers
attention long enough for them to consider publishing it. (Get someone that
doesn't know you to judge it to get an honest opinion.) Some publishers won't
publish it even if it's the best game they've seen if it isn't the type of game
that they &quot;typically&quot; publish. Some companies only publish movie
conversions, some only publish sports titles, etc...<BR><BR>Here is what Doug
Tennapel (creator of Earthworm Jim) had to say in a interview on gamasutra.com:<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Have you any advice for developers starting out on their own and looking
to land publishing deals ?</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Get a great lawyer, do the best work in the industry and you will get a
publishing deal. Most developers don't pay attention to the &quot;best work in
the industry&quot; part so I'll repeat it: if you don't do the best work in the
industry, nobody will or should take a chance on                    you.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><STRONG>Small
Publishers</STRONG> -  Be very careful about sending your game to a small
publisher even if they sign an NDA first. There often is a reason they are
small. They often are honest and trying to break into the market or they can be
corrupt. It doesn't take much for a small company to get your game ROM, have
their own hackers modify it slightly, copyright it in their own country, and
then sell it to some foreign country for a profit. With you receiving nothing in
return except them giving you a notice, &quot;We don't think your game is
suitable for publication but please submit any future complete games to us for
consideration.&quot;<BR><BR>   Do NOT sent your complete game to a small
publisher unless they can give you references to people for which they have
published work. If they can't give you references this should set off some major
alarms in your head. Either you are their first &quot;experiment&quot; at
entering into publishing or they could be corrupt. Keep in mind as well that 9
out of 10 companies fail in their first year of business.<BR><BR><BR><STRONG>Large
Publishers</STRONG> -  The larger a company gets, the more that company can get
to a point where the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. (A
case in point is that Nintendo of America has made some announcements before
about products to be introduced or not introduced and Nintendo of Japan [the
main location] soon after made a decision that basically reversed the
announcement made by NOA.)<BR><BR>In other words, you can't just expect to
send your brand new, state-of-the-art, best-graphics-in-the-world GBC game to
anyone in the company and expect them to forward it to the actual decision
makers. Many people in large companies could care less about what you have done.
Many would not know what to do with a ROM even if you sent it to them. Often,
your email goes directly to the trash if it is sent to the wrong person. Meeting
people at game industry shows is probably the best method for meeting the right
people. 
<BR><BR>Keep in mind as well that fast decisions or any decisions at all are
often harder to get from large publishers. Their main way of doing things is to
let their market research department decide what to publish next.<BR><BR><BR></DD>

  <DD><BR>
    Yes, but you can only run GB/GBC games. You can not run GBA games on a GB 
    cart. The cart interface uses a different voltage and the cart address and 
    data lines are layed out totally differently. An autodetect circuit is used 
    to tell what type of cart is installed and you are then forced into GB or 
    GBA mode.<BR>

    The GBC has more sophisticated testing. In order to display your own logo

<DL><DT><STRONG><A NAME="Emulator">What are GB, EPROM, and IS emulators ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Emulator can be a confusing word because it have several meanings
depending on where it is used:<BR><BR>A GB emulator is a piece of software
that runs on a computer and emulates a GB and/or GBC. The reality is that none
of the GB emulators available perfectly emulate the real hardware but some come
close. Many think that NO$GMB has the current best GB/GBC/SGB emulation &amp; it
also has a powerful debugger for helping developers with coding. SMYGB for Win95
currently is thought by many to have the best sound emulation but it can't play
channel 3 sound samples very well.<BR><BR>An EPROM emulator is a piece of
hardware that perfectly emulates a ROM or EPROM chip. They often connect to the
parallel port of a PC and connect to a ROM socket. Software code changes can
often be downloaded in seconds to the ROM socket. EPROM emulators are not very
practical for most as they tend to be very expensive &amp; require that you
physically solder a socket onto a GB cart to allow connecting an EPROM emulator
to the cart.<BR><BR>The emulator that
<A HREF="#ProHardware">Intelligent Systems</A> sells is basically an expensive
EPROM emulator. The debugger they sell is the same thing along with hardware
break points, trace history buffer, and other debug features. They both program
Nintendo flash carts as well.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="EMU2GB">Why does my code that runs on an emulator not
run on a real GB ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR> * Emulators tend to set all of RAM to $00 on power up. Real GBs do
NOT initialize RAM on power up. RAM is filled with random values on power up.
You must clear it yourself if you wish it to be set to some known value.<BR><BR>*
The real hardware could care less about the ROM checksum ($14e,$14f) but the
complement check ($14d) MUST be correct or programs will &quot;lock up&quot;
after scrolling the Nintendo logo. (Use RGBFIX -V if you are coding in
assembly.)<BR><BR>* The Nintendo scrolling graphic from $104 - $133 must be
accurate. If one byte of it is changed then your programs will &quot;lock up&quot;
after scrolling this graphic logo.<BR><BR>* When the LCD display is off (bit 7
of $ff40 set to 0) you can write to video memory at any time with out
restrictions. While it is on you can only write to video memory during H-Blank
and V-Blank. Emulators tend to allow you to write to video memory at any time.<BR><BR>*
The LCD display is on at reset (bit 7 of $ff40 set to 1). Before the LCD display
can be turned off you must wait for V-Blank. If you don't wait for V-Blank, once
in a while SGB code will just lock up and possibly some GBC will not operate
correctly.<BR><BR>* Normally you should only make changes to Sprite RAM during
V-Blank unless you know exactly what you are doing. The common way to do this is
to use the Sprite DMA register ($ff46) to do a fast copy from your sprite table
to sprite RAM at $fe00-$fe9f.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="EmuCol">Why do colo(u)rs look washed out on some GB
emulators (i.e. no$gmb, etc) but not on others ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>This is because code has been added to in order to do &quot;colo(u)r
correction&quot; . This &quot;correction&quot; code creates washed out colo(u)rs
to better simulate how the game appears (or would appear) on the real GBC
hardware.<BR><BR>Often, GB emulators (such as no$gmb) have a configuration
option to enable or disable this &quot;auto correction&quot; feature.<BR><BR>The

reds seem to be faded.<BR><BR><BR></DD></DL>

colo(u)rs per tile, has a secret high resolution mode, and can do 3D graphics in

<DD><BR>None of this is true except possibly the first one. You might can do
more than 4 colo(u)rs but only through creative palette manipulation during
H-Blank. This is not practical for many things and is only achievable if you
know exactly what you are doing.<BR><BR>Read the GBC Specification in the Web

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="APAGraphics">How do I turn individual pixels on &amp;
off (i.e. APA graphics) instead of drawing with tiles ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>The ability to turn individual pixels on &amp; off on the screen is
often called APA (or All Points Addressable) graphics.<BR><BR>On the GBC you
can do this by putting a unique tile at each screen map location. Since the GBC
can have 512 unique tiles, 360 of these are enough to cover the entire screen
(20x18 tiles.) Then you can set individual screen pixels to any colo(u)r by
writing to tile memory.<BR><BR>On the other GBs (pocket, classic, super) you
only have access to 256 tiles at one time which is less than the 360 unique
tiles required to fill the screen. But, by using a LYC interrupt you can switch
from tile set #1 to tile set #2 midscreen. This effectively allows you access to
up to 384 unique tiles (since tile set #1 &amp; #2 half overlap each other)
which is enough to fill the screen to allow APA graphics.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="ManyClrs">How do some GBC games put more than 56

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="GBCSetPal">Can GBC palettes be set at any time ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>No. Specifically, you can write to GBC palettes at any time except
during video mode 3. While the screen is off you can write to the palettes at
any time.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="GBCvsSGB">The GBC &amp; SGB both support colo(u)r. Is
graphics programming for them similar ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Not really. They both have in common the ability to display graphics
written for GB pocket &amp; GB classic but that is where the similarities end.<BR><BR>The
SGB is able to colo(u)rize GB games using primitive techniques that involve
sending information to the SNES/Super Famicon. As such, if you attempt to scroll
the screen it is sometimes a slow process to send new information to the SNES so
colo(u)rized, scrolling screens are difficult to implement.<BR><BR>The GBC, on
the other hand, does all colo(u)rizing itself using totally different methods.
As a result, colo(u)rized games written for the GBC will not work on the SGB &amp;
vice versa.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="WinBack">What is the difference between the GB window
and the GB background ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>The GB background map is often used as the &quot;main&quot; game
screen map. You can scroll the background in any direction without limitations.<BR><BR>The
GB window map appears on top of the background and can only be scrolled to the
right and down from the upper left screen coordinate. You can scroll it up as
long as the Y coordinate is &gt;=0. You can scroll it left as long as X
coordinate is &gt;=-7. The window is often used as a status bar on the right or
bottom of the screen. No part of the window can ever be made transparent to the
background under it.<BR><BR>If you set a sprite &amp; it's priority to appear
below the background &amp; the window, you can see the sprite under window
colo(u)r 0 but you can't see the background under window colo(u)r 0. It is as if
the window has replaced the background at all points that it appears on screen.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="Trans">Can any part of the window be made transparent ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>No part of the window can be made transparent to display the

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="GBCHDMA">What precautions should I use when doing HDMA
on a GBC ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>- If you initiate an HDMA from a ROM bank ($4000-$7fff) to VRAM you
can not change the ROM bank until the HDMA has completed. (You can change ROM
banks during HDMA ONLY if you are not using a ROM bank as a source for the HDMA
data being transferred.)<BR><BR>- If you initiate an HDMA from a RAM bank
($d000-$dfff) to VRAM you can not change the RAM bank until the HDMA has
completed.  (You can change RAM banks during HDMA ONLY if you are not using a
RAM bank as a source for the HDMA data being transferred.)<BR><BR>- Once you
initiate an HDMA you can not change the Video RAM bank ($8000-$9fff) until HDMA
has completed.<BR><BR>- Source &amp; destination addresses of the HDMA must be
16 byte aligned. (i.e. Source &amp; destination addresses must have a hex value
of $xxx0. )<BR><BR>- It will not work if the screen is off.  Nothing will
happen.
<BR><BR>- It will not work if you use the assembly command HALT in your main
loop.<BR><BR>- It will not work properly if you try to set up another send
while it is still sending the last one. HDMA only takes place during H-blank on
screen lines 1-144 (lines 0-143 if using LY numbering system). During other
times (including V-blank) HDMA is paused.<BR><BR>- Make sure your transfer
length is correct. (i.e. HDMA5 [$ff55]: $80 = 16 bytes, $81 = 32 bytes, .... ,
$ff = 2048 bytes)<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="HDMADone">How do I know when an HDMA on the GBC has
completed ?</A></STRONG></DT>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="GBCGDMA">What precautions should I use when doing GDMA
on a GBC ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>- GDMA can only reliably be performed in V-blank while the screen is
on. While the screen is off it can be performed at any time. Turn the LCD screen
on only AFTER enabling an interrupt if that interrupt is used to service GDMA.
That way any pending GDMA will not occur during screen drawing (non-vblank).<BR><BR>-
During the execution of GDMA the CPU is devoted to DMA only and no other
processing can take place. <BR><BR>- If you plan to transfer more than ~1600
bytes (~100 tiles) in one V-blank while the screen is on then you probably will
need to use double-speed mode. GDMA is slightly faster in double-speed mode and
will allow transfers up to 2048 bytes in this mode. If your V-blank interrupt
code is exceptionally long then large GDMA transfers are not feasible if they
overrun the end of V-blank.<BR><BR>- Make sure your source &amp; destination
addresses are 16 byte aligned (same as HDMA) and that your transfer length is
correct. (i.e. HDMA5 [$ff55]: $00 = 16 bytes, $01 = 32 bytes, .... , $7f = 2048
bytes)<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="GDMATime">How long does it take for a GDMA to execute on
a GBC ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>It takes (220 + (n * 7.63)) microseconds in single speed and (110 + (n
* 7.63)) microseconds in double speed mode. (Where n = 0 is 16 bytes, n = 1 is
32 bytes, n=2 is 48 bytes, etc... ) This translates to a transfer rate of
2097152 bytes/sec if you don't consider the initial startup delay of 220uS
(110uS in double speed mode.) The value 110uS is accurate within +/-5uS. The
value 220uS is accurate within +/- 10uS. <BR><BR> One of the Nintendos docs
says, &quot;The new DMA transfer operates at a constant speed, regardless of
whether the CPU is in Normal or Double Speed Mode&quot; but this is not exactly
correct information.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="GBCAttrib">I read somewhere that you must set GBC tile
attributes before setting the GBC tile map. Is this true ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Setting the tile attributes directly after setting the map tiles can

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="LYCTrash">I'm using the LYC interrupt as a trigger to
modify the SCX and/or SCY scroll registers. I get some graphic &quot;trash&quot;
on the screen line where the LYC occurs. Why ? And how do I fix it ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>The reason you often will get graphic trash is because the LYC
interrupt, itself, is getting delayed from occurring perfectly on time due to
some other interrupt (usually due to a timer, serial, or hi/lo interrupt.)<BR><BR>One
way to fix this is to make sure that the screen line that this occurs on is
always one solid colo(u)r. In this way, the problem still occurs but isn't
visibly noticeable so for all practical purposes the problem is &quot;fixed&quot;.<BR><BR>Another
way to fix this problem is to have the LYC interrupt occur one line before you
actually need it. Then, use a tight loop waiting for the LY register to equal
the next line. If the other interrupt code (that is causing this problem) is
extremely long then you may need to set the LYC interrupt to occur several lines
or more before it is actually needed. Mortal Kombat 3 &amp; 4 for GB use this
technique to prevent graphic trash.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="VideoTiming"> What are the video timing specs for the GB

info on the various video modes refer to a reference for register STAT ($ff41).
Horizontal lines which contain sprites have less H-Blank time available than
lines with no sprites. No H-Blank time is available during an active HDMA:<BR><BR>Complete
horizontal line timing = 108.7 &#181;sec<BR>V-Blank = 1.09 msec<BR>Mode 2 =

(no sprites on a line)<BR><BR>Each video line contains mode 2, mode 3 and mode
0 in that order. GBC palettes can be written during every mode except mode 3. An
LYC interrupt occurs at the start of mode 2. An H-Blank interrupt occurs at the
start of mode 0.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="Interlace">Why do pictures in the background or window
often appear distorted if you scroll them up or down 1 pixel each V-Blank ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>This is because all versions of GB (i.e. GB,GBC,GBP,SGB,...) have
interlaced screens and are redrawn 30 times a second. (i.e. All odd lines are
drawn in one screen refresh, all even lines are drawn in the next screen
refresh.) As a result, if you scroll a picture up or down 1 pixel each V-Blank
you are seeing every other line twice during scrolling. (Info of GBC interlace
from Pan of Anthrox.)<BR><BR>The GB screen isn't a true interlaced screen. It

what assembly code should be used ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>It's not a good idea to turn off the screen unless you are in V-blank
for the following reasons:<BR><BR>- Code written for the Super GameBoy will
not always work if you don't wait until V-blank to switch off the screen. The
screen &quot;glitch&quot; caused by turning the screen off during redraw can
sometimes cause the Super GameBoy screen to &quot;lockup&quot; until reset is
pressed.<BR><BR>- It has been reported that Nintendo rejects game titles
during the acceptance phase if they don't wait until V-blank to turn off the
screen. It has also been reported by Nintendo Acceptance that some code can
physically damage the GBC screen circuitry over time. It is believed (but not
verified) that this damage occurs due to not waiting until V-blank to turn off
the screen.<BR><BR>Here is assembly code that is similar to what Nintendo

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="Blanks">Why does the GB have H-blank &amp; V-blank
periods in the video timing ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>The terms H-blank &amp; V-blank are a part of Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)
based video games and as a result they have carried over to some LCD-based
games. The H-blank period is the amount of time it takes the scanning electron
beam to return to the left part of the screen and the V-blank period is the
amount of time it takes the scanning electron beam to return to the top of the
screen for CRT displays.<BR><BR> Since the Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) of the
GB doesn't have an electron beam there are no lag times that require an H-blank
or a V-blank period. Since the GB doesn't have dual-port video RAM, allocating
these times anyway provides a convenient time for writes to video RAM since the
video circuits aren't updating the screen during these periods (and as such
aren't preventing access to video RAM during these periods.)<BR><BR><BR></DD></DL>
<HR>
<DL><DT><STRONG><A NAME="IntWhat">What is an interrupt ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>An interrupt is a piece of code that starts executing automatically
when an event occurs. To do this it has to interrupt whatever code was running
before the event occurred. As part of this, the Program Counter (PC) is saved on
the GB stack and interrupts are turned off as soon as the interrupt code starts
executing. At the end of the interrupt, a RETI assembly instruction is usually
executed which returns to executing code that was running before the interrupt
occurred and enables interrupts again.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="IntCaution">What precautions should I use when writing
interrupt code ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>You should often try to keep your interrupt code as short &amp; fast
as possible. In many cases, no other interrupt can take place while you are
servicing an interrupt so shorter interrupt code can be helpful.<BR><BR>Usually
you should enable interrupts before turning on the screen. This way, any old
vblank or hblank interrupt that is still pending but never got serviced will
occur before screen drawing starts. For instance, many people write vblank code
that must only occur in vblank or while the screen is off or else problems will
result while attempting to execute this code during the screen refresh phase.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="IntInt">Can an interrupt interrupt another interrupt ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Normally, no. When an interrupt occurs it automatically executes a
Disable Interrupts (DI) command. As a result, no other interrupt can be serviced
until servicing of that interrupt is complete and the assembly instruction RETI
is executed.<BR><BR>To allow an interrupt to interrupt an interrupt you need
to put an Enable Interrupt (EI) instruction at the beginning of each interrupt
routine where interrupting will be allowed.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="RET&RETI">What is the difference between assembly
commands RET &amp; RETI ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>RET is just a return from subroutine. RETI is two commands in one.
RETI is EI / RET in that order. The command EI doesn't take effect immediately
but DI does. EI takes effect following the instruction that follows it.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="HILOWork">I can't get the HI/LO (joypad) interrupt to

process of pressing a button and several times while releasing a button due to
button &quot;bounce&quot; that often occurs but few realize it.<BR><BR><BR></DD>

<DD><BR>No. Specifically, when working in assembly you need a small delay
between EI &amp; DI. If you insert a NOP command between EI &amp; DI then this
allows the interrupt enable command to complete before DI takes effect. Thus
allowing all pending interrupts to be serviced before interrupts are disabled.
Any pending interrupts will be serviced in the order of their priority and they
all will be serviced at once before control is returned to non-interrupt code.<BR><BR>The
reason this delay is needed is because the assembly command EI doesn't take
effect immediately but DI does. EI takes effect following the instruction that
follows it.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="IntLCDC">Is there anything I should know when using the
LCDC interrupt ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>There is one Int $48 signal. When this signal goes from &quot;off&quot;
to &quot;on&quot; the LCDC flag in the register IF ($ff0f) gets set, and ONLY on
off-to-on transitions.
<BR><BR> If the signal is already &quot;on&quot;, say by a true (and enabled)
LYC=LY condition, then a further interrupt in the same line (say HBLANK int is
enabled as well) would set the int48 signal as well, but it's already set so no
off-to-on transition, no further interrupt generated.<BR><BR> But the HBLANK
interrupt could occur if LYC=LY would get disabled or false (lyc changed) within
the line, ie. if int48 signal gets off for a short moment. (Info from M.K.)<BR><BR><BR></DD></DL>

<DD><BR>On the GB/GB Pocket/GB Classic:<BR>This pin connects to the front
panel button array and is a digital output line from register P1 ($ff00) bit 4.<BR><BR>On
the GBC:<BR> This pin connects to register RP ($ff56) bit 4 and is a digital
input pin. (Info from Ken Kaarvik.)<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="LinkSerial">Can the serial link port be used to connect
to other serial devices ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>You possibly could use pin 4 of the link port on the GBC as a serial
input. You would need to write a software UART to handle the input data. Since
there would be no interrupt involved in monitoring this input pin you would need
to devote a good bit of CPU time to monitoring this pin &amp; probably no
interrupts would be feasible while looking for serial data.<BR><BR>As far as
the GB Pocket or GB Classic goes, the standard serial in &amp; out pins on the
GB have a serial format that is not compatible with any known serial standard.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="GBCLink">I'm trying to write code to communicate with
another GB using the link port. Are there any suggested algorithms for doing
this ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR> This might possibly be the single most difficult thing on the GB to
program: GB-to-GB link code. First, get chapters 4 &amp; 5 of the official GB
development manual. You might even can locate these somewhere on the internet.
You have 2 different options. The chapter 4 (simple code) or chapter 5
(complicated code). If you wish to transfer more than 1 byte per vblank then you
MUST use chapter 5 code for reliability<BR><BR> Chapter 4 has two different
modes. The first mode is synchronization (before the game starts) and this
flowchart is shown on the first page. The second mode is &quot;after the game
starts&quot; flowchart which is shown on page 2.
<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="GBCDMG">I get an unreliable game link connection when
connecting a GB Pocket or Classic to a GBC. What might cause this ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>When a DMG (GB Pocket or Classic) and CGB are linked together, and an
AC Adaptor is used, line noise may occur.  This noise can cause communication
problems with the SCK (link clock), which could bit-shift received data. This
seems to occur mainly when the DMG is the Master mode (using its internal
clock.) This problem doesn't seem to occur when the GBC is the master.<BR><BR>There
are two ways to solve this. You can forcibly make the GBC the master, or you can
create better error checking routines to correct this problem. Nintendo
recommends using the latter option.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="LinkConn">Is the GB link connector available anywhere ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>The original (larger) GB Classic and the newer (smaller) GB Pocket /

elsewhere. You need to modify existing cables in order to use these connectors.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="LinkSize">With the introduction of the GB Pocket the
link port connector is smaller than it was on the GB Classic. Are the changes
only physical ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Yes. With the proper conversion connector you can link different size
link port units together.<BR><BR>With the introduction of the GBC, link port
pin 4 now has a new function but the official Nintendo game link cable for
connecting two different game units has never supported pin 4 so this change has
no immediate impact. Pin 4 might possibly be used by some future Nintendo
peripheral but currently it is not used.<BR><BR><BR></DD>

double-speed mode can operate at ~2 million machine cycles/sec or ~8 million

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="DMAModes">What are all of the DMA modes &amp; what are
they used for ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR><STRONG> Sprite DMA</STRONG> -<BR>This is the original DMA that is
available on all models of GB. It is used to do a fast copy of sprite attribute
data to Object (sprite) Attribute Memory (OAM) located at $fe00-$fe9f. Sprite
attribute data includes sprite X &amp; Y coordinates, tile number, palette
number, horizontal flip, vertical flip, and sprite priority. No tile graphics
are transferred using this method of DMA.<BR>This method of DMA usually is only
performed in high RAM ($ff80-$fffe) due to its <A HREF="#SpriteDMA">limitations</A>.<BR><BR><STRONG>HDMA</STRONG>
-<BR>Otherwise known as Horizontal Blank DMA. It is only available on the GBC.
Similar to GDMA, this method of DMA is useful for copying tile graphics or tile
maps to video RAM. There are many restrictions to using HDMA listed
<A HREF="#GBCHDMA">here</A> but it can be powerful if used carefully. Unlike
the other two methods of DMA, this one is most practical for allowing other
processing to take place while HDMA is occurring. More specifically, the CPU is
used completely during H-blank to process HDMA but at all other times user code
may be doing other things.<BR><BR><STRONG>GDMA</STRONG> -<BR>Otherwise known
as General Purpose DMA. It is only available on the GBC. Similar to HDMA, this
method of DMA is useful for copying tile graphics or tile maps to video RAM.
There are some restrictions listed <A HREF="#GBCGDMA">here</A> for using GDMA
but far less than for HDMA. While GDMA is active, the CPU is completely devoted
to DMA and no other processing takes place until GDMA is done.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="Endian">Is the GB a big or little endian system ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR> The GB, GBC, &amp; Z80 are all evolutions of the original Intel 8080
and all of these are little endian systems. When pushing data on the stack or
using the assembly command LD [xxxx],SP the low byte is stored lower in RAM.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="IRRemote">Is it possible to use the Infrared capability
of the GBC for a IR remote control ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Yes.The GBC IR transmitter can even operate at over 100kHz. But,
transmit distance drops off dramatically at 100kHz and higher.<BR><BR>One
person was able to code an IR remote that would transmit to a TV reliably up to
3 metres (10 feet) and unreliably up to 5 metres (15 feet).<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="GBCProb1">I have written a program for the GBC. Normal

<DD><BR>You must set rom address $143 to $80 for a GB/GBC game or to $c0 for a

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="GBCTitle"> With the introduction of the GBC, the
internal cart name has been made smaller. Is this correct ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Yes. Rom location $143 was turned into a flag that indicated a GBC
game so the internal cart name was reduced in size from 16 to 15 characters. The
GBC flag is $80 for a GBC compatible or dedicated game. Any other value
signifies a non-GBC game.<BR><BR>As of 1-Mar-99, all GBC games have an even
smaller internal cart name of 11 characters. The four ascii characters following
the internal cart name are now dedicated to the game product code. As part of
this change, the GBC flag byte was changed: $80 = GBC compatible game, $c0 = GBC
dedicated game. Any other values signify a non-GBC game.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="GBCDed">So why did Nintendo change rom address $143 from
$80 to $c0 for a GBC dedicated game ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Because they wanted a method of distinguishing a GBC-compatible game
from a GBC-dedicated game. There is no hardware reason for this change.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="HALT">What is the assembly language command HALT used
for ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>This stops the CPU until an interrupt occurs. Nintendo recommends
using this command in your main game loop in order to save battery power while
the CPU has nothing else to do.<BR><BR>When an interrupt occurs while in HALT,
the CPU starts back up and pushes the Program Counter onto the stack before
servicing the interrupt(s). Except it doesn't push the address after HALT as one
might expect but rather the address of HALT itself.<BR><BR>HALT operates
differently depending on whether the Interrupt Master Enable (IME) is set or
reset. Assembly command EI sets IME to 1. Assembly command DI resets IME to 0.<BR><BR><PRE><STRONG>IME = 1 -</STRONG>

     HALT stops the CPU until the register IF ($ff0f) &amp;
    register IE ($ffff) when logically ANDed together
    have a non-zero result.

     HALT will only start the CPU upon a 0 to 1 transition
    of one of the bits of the non-zero result. (i.e. Pending
    interrupts that occurred before HALT was executed will
    not terminate HALT.)


<STRONG>IME = 0 -</STRONG>

    <STRONG>[$ff0f].AND.[$ffff] = 0 :</STRONG>

        HALT is aborted. Next instruction is executed normally.

         If IME is set to 1 at a later time then a halt condition
        will occur one instruction after IME is set to 1 to complete
        the halt that was not allowed to finish earlier.

    <STRONG>[$ff0f].AND.[$ffff] &gt; 0 :</STRONG>

         HALT is aborted. The first byte of the next instruction
        after HALT is read. The Program Counter (PC) fails to
        increment to the next memory location. As a results, the
        first byte after HALT is read again. From this point on
        the Program Counter once again operates normally.

         If IME is set to 1 at a later time then a halt condition
        will occur one instruction after IME is set to 1 to complete
        the halt that was not allowed to finish earlier.
</PRE><BR>Nintendo also recommends that you put a NOP after HALT commands. The
reason for this is that the Program Counter will not increment properly (CPU
bug) if you try to do a HALT while IME = 0 and an interrupt is pending. A
single-byte instruction immediately following HALT will get executed twice if
IME = 0 and an interrupt is pending. If the instruction following HALT is a
multi-byte instruction then the game could hang or registers could get
scrambled.<BR><BR>IME is set to 1 even if the assembly instruction EI is
executed immediately before the HALT instruction.<BR><BR>Later versions of the
RGBASM compiler automatically add a NOP after HALT.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="STOP">What is the assembly language command STOP and
how/when should it be used ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>This stops the CPU &amp; turns off the display until a button is
pressed.<BR><BR>In addition, STOP can be used to <A HREF="#AsmToggle">toggle
CPU speed</A> on the GBC.<BR><BR>If a game is idle for 5 minutes or longer you
should possibly consider using STOP to stop the CPU &amp; turn off the display
to conserve power. Everything is restored after a STOP just by pressing a
button. If you use STOP for conversing power you should also consider disabling
sound (reset bit 7 of NR52) as the sound circuits seem to draw the most amount
of power.<BR><BR>The value in register P1 ($ff00) determines which buttons
will terminate the STOP condition. These values are as follows and apply to both
the GB &amp; GBC:<BR><BR>$00 - Any button will terminate STOP.<BR>$10 - Only
A, B, Select, or Start will terminate STOP.<BR>$20 - Only the direction buttons
will terminate STOP.<BR>$30 - No button will terminate STOP.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="GBBugs">Are there any undocumented bugs of the GB ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Yes. If the windows X ($ff4b) is set to 0, and you scroll the
background map horizontally (via $ff43), the window scrolls horizontally with it
for 8 pixel, then &quot;hops&quot; back to were it should be. This occurs on the
original GB, pocket GB, and GBC.<BR><BR>There is the <A HREF="#SpriteBug">sprites
bug</A> that was fixed in the GBC and also the following that doesn't apply to
the GBC.<BR><BR>In certain situations, writing to the STAT register ($ff41)
seems to cause bit 1 of the IF register ($ff0f) to be set (and thus cause
interrupt $48 to occur, if it is enabled). Due to programming bugs, at least two
games (Roadrash, Legend of Zerd) insist on this quirk, and are incompatible with
the GBC.
<BR><BR> As far as has been figured out, the bug happens everytime ANYTHING
(including 00) is written to the STAT register ($ff41) while the gameboy is
either in HBLANK or VBLANK mode. It doesn't seem to happen when the gameboy is
in OAM or VRAM mode, or when the display is disabled. (Info from Martin Korth.)<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="GBCUndoc">Are there any undocumented features of the GBC
?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR> Yes. The byte at location $143 in a ROM determines whether the GBC
operates in GBC mode ($80 or $c0) or 4-color GB mode (any other value.) That is
the official info anyway. Martin Korth has found that any of the following
binary values at $143 cause strange sprite colors &amp; white-only background
colors always (X = don't care):<BR><BR>   1XXX01XX<BR>  1XXX10XX<BR> 
1XXX11XX<BR><BR>It is as if bits 2 and/or 3 being set cause the colo(u)r
palette registers to be write-protected. On power up, the sprite palettes tend
to be random pastel colo(u)rs &amp; the background palettes are white.<BR><BR><BR>If
you read HDMA5 ($ff55) after starting an HDMA you will read back the tile count
you wrote except the high bit will be 0. Every H-blank this count will
decrement. After reaching $00 it will change to $ff indicating that HDMA has
completed. (i.e. If bit 7 is 0 HDMA is busy, otherwise HDMA is done.)<BR><BR><BR>There
are also several undocumented registers (info from Dark Fader):<BR><BR>$FF6C -
bit 0 can be read/written<BR> $FF72-$FF74 - whole byte can be read/written<BR>
$FF75 - bit 4-6 can be read/written<BR> $FF76-$FF77 - Read only &amp; set to
$00<BR><BR><BR>For the record, Nintendo recommends against using undocumented
registers in order that your code will work properly with future releases of
hardware. It is not clear whether the bit that tells you that HDMA is done was
accidentally undocumented or undocumented on purpose.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="GBCLCDC0">Does the GBC register LCDC ($ff40) bit 0 do

If used for the GB stack, does it provide better performance ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>No better performance can be obtained by using high RAM for the GB
stack. But, if you are coding in assembly language, some opcodes are optimized
(and hence operate faster) when using high RAM for data storage. For high
performance code it is actually better to put the GB stack in lower RAM and use
high RAM for data storage instead.<BR><BR>Sprite DMA code must be performed in
high RAM because all other memory is disabled during Sprite DMA.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="Metatiles">What does the term Metatile mean ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>In the world of GB, Metatiles are virtual tiles that are larger than
8x8 pixels. In many/most cases, metatiles are 16x16 pixel virtual tiles. In some
cases they are 8x16, 16x8, 32x32, or even larger. Metatiles are most often used
anywhere that you have large scrolling maps.<BR><BR>Games such as Donkey Kong
Land 3, Mortal Kombat 3, Mortal Kombat 4, and Tarzan all use 16x16 metatiles.
These games use a metatile map as well. Each position of this map usually
contains 1 or 2 bytes. If each position has one byte then up to 256 unique
metatiles can be used by the map. These metatile maps can be nearly 4 (or 8 for
the GBC) times smaller (ROM space wise) than a similar tile map that doesn't use
metatiles. If each position of the map uses 2 bytes then the map can support
many unique metatiles. These metatile maps can be 2 (or 4 for the GBC) times
smaller (ROM space wise) than a similar tile map that doesn't use metatiles.<BR><BR>Each
position of a metatile map has an index into a metatile lookup table. Each
position in the metatile lookup table often has 4 bytes (assuming 16x16
metatiles) that index 4 different 8x8 tiles in the tile table and there are
often 4 more bytes (assuming 16x16 metatiles) that hold the tile attributes for
these tiles for GBC support.<BR><BR>When using metatiles, you lose some ROM
space due to the addition of a metatile table but you often gain much more ROM
space than you lose due to the much smaller map(s). The space savings often
means that you can put a much larger map (pixel-wise) into a single ROM bank
which can make things easier programming wise.<BR><BR>The concept of metatiles
often assumes as well that 8x8 tiles will be used in multiple metatiles. This is
often a very good assumption because the GB &amp; GBC just don't have enough 8x8
tiles available to provide unique tiles at every screen location in large,
scrolling maps. It is possible to dynamically load unique tiles at the edges of
a scrolling screen (in order to have all unique tiles) but the ROM space
required for all of these unique tiles can often be prohibitive.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="PowerUsage">Is it possible to drain the batteries
quicker through poor code ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR> Yes. The following table illustrates power usage by the GBC. Sound is
enabled by setting bit 7 of register NR52 ($ff26). Using assembly language
command HALT in your main game loop saves power. 2X Spd is double speed mode.
Infrared Receive is enabled by setting bits 6 &amp; 7 of register RP ($ff56).
Infrared Transmit is turned on by setting bit 0 of register RP ($$ff56).<BR><BR>These
measurements are for total current (cart &amp; GBC) drawn from the batteries.
The cart used for testing was an original MBC5 cart with the ROM replaced with a
low-power flash chip. As a result, these measurements should compare to a
Nintendo published ROM cart within 1-2 milliamps. The code in this example used
about 85% of the clock cycles available each game loop. (With low power
consumption for 15% of each game loop when HALT was used.) This probably closely
resembles many games.<BR><BR>As can be seen by the results, the best results
are obtained by using none of the special features available, sound disabled,
and using HALT in the main game loop. Ideally, your game should use as little
battery power as is necessary. In other words, do NOT use features that require
more battery power unless you can not accomplish what you are trying to do
without using them.<BR><BR>For those that are confused by the values below,
consider that a game that uses 55 milliamps will run on batteries for twice as
many hours as a game that uses 110 milliamps. Actually, it will run for a little
over twice as long but this gets into battery physics that are beyond the scope
of these FAQs.<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER="2"><TR><TD COLSTART="1">Milliamps</TD><TD

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="PadROM">Is it important to pad a ROM with a specific
value ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR> Yes, for three reasons:<BR><BR>- Some flash carts program much more
quickly when unused spaces in the ROM are padded with $ff.<BR><BR>- ROMs that
have unused areas padded with a known value (rather than random data) compress
much better. This is good when you need to send a ROM by email or for smaller,
compressed, backup archives.<BR><BR>- Padding makes sure that unused sections
of the ROM are filled with a known value rather than random data in your PC RAM.
If you don't use padding sometimes source code or other information that you
would rather not make public can be included in your ROM without your even
knowing about it.
<BR><BR><BR> To test code on a GB you often have to pad your ROM size to a
multiple of 2 in order for most flash programming tools to use the file. Padding
is just unused bytes that are added to fill empty spaces in a ROM or at the end
of a ROM. The type of padding you choose can greatly vary the amount of time it
takes to program a Bung (and probably other) flash cart. With padding values of
$00 being the worst and $ff being the best. Sometimes it can take up to 50%
longer (maybe even longer) to flash a cart with pad values of $00. Here are
command line switches for properly padding assembly files:<BR><BR>For RGBASM:
<STRONG>-zff</STRONG><BR><BR>For XLINK (RGBASM linker): <STRONG>-zff</STRONG><BR><BR>For
RGBFIX (Version by Otaku): <STRONG>-pff</STRONG><BR><BR>For TASM: <STRONG>-fff</STRONG><BR><BR>(Bung

<HR>
<DL><DT><STRONG><A NAME="SndDiffs">Are there any differences in the sound
hardware on the GB, GBC, &amp; SGB ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>The GB Classic, GB Pocket, SGB, &amp; GBC all use the same sound
hardware so programmming is identical for them all.<BR><BR>The SGB, however,
has access to some SNES/Super Famicon sound effects as well. SGB games that have
specifically been written to use these sound effects can have better sound, as a
result, than average GB games.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="SndOrder">Does it matter in which order I set the sound
registers ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Yes. Sound must be turned on before you can set any other sound
registers. You do this by writing $80 to NR52 ($ff26).<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="SndWaves"> What all techniques are used to play WAV
files on a GB ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Four bit wave playback - Sound channel 3 has a 4-bit 32 sample long
wave RAM that you can set for playing a 32 sample waveform repeatedly. It wasn't
specifically designed to handle continuously new samples but you can refill the
wave RAM each time 32 samples have been sent to the speaker. This reload of RAM
process causes the first sample to always be 0 which shows up in sample playback
as a low frequency buzz sound. Depending on what sounds you are playing back
this buzz is more or less noticeable.<BR><BR>Your samples will sound a lot
clearer (and even louder, apparently) if you heavily optimize your sample
playback routine. (Info from Jeremy Evers.)<BR><BR> One bit wave playback -
Some games use volume modulation of register NR51 ($ff25) to do one bit wave
playback. This involves setting, say for instance, sound channel 3 wave RAM to
all $FF's and then just modulating bits 2 &amp; 6 of NR51 to do the sound
playback.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="SndVolume">I get very low volume when playing WAVs. What
can I do ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>This is a major problem and as a result it requires careful
consideration.<BR><BR>For one, use compression (audio, not data) to make the
sample &quot;stronger&quot;.<BR><BR>Also, make sure that the original sound
sample files are recorded very strongly. If you have to, use a sound editor
program to increase the volume of each sample. Keep doing this even if the
signal starts to clip if you want to get more volume.<BR><BR>It is a matter of
personal preference as to how much clipping you wish to do to the sample. The
more clipping you do the louder the sample will be with the trade off of adding
more distortion. Some samples will be more tolerant of distortion than others so
keep this in mind.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="SndDisable"> Should I disable sound if I am not using it
?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Yes. The sound circuits cause your game to use 10-15% more battery
power even if you aren't actively playing a sound. Write $00 to NR52 ($ff26) to
disable sound.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="SndEnv">Can I dynamically modulate the volume envelope
of a sound channel while it is playing ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>If you alter the envelope, the envelope may restart (or at least
jump), and there are some things you need to take into account. However, if you
force the envelope to be off (direction up, speed 0), you can easily make
software envelopes by modulating the high nybble.  Sometimes there is some small
noise associated with this technique, however... (Info from Jeremy Evers.)<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="WaveRamMod">Can Wave Pattern RAM ($ff30-ff3f) be
modified at any time ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>No. Sound channel 3 must be disabled before you can write data to Wave
Pattern RAM ($ff30-ff3f). Sound channel 3 is disabled by writing $00 to NR30
($ff1a).<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="Sweep">Is there anything I need to know about using &quot;sweep&quot;
?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Yes. Using the sweep function on sound channel 1 will destroy the
contents of the frequency registers NR13 ($ff13) &amp; NR14 ($ff14).<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="GBSndBugs">Are there any bugs in the GB sound hardware ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Yes. A problem with sound being cut off prematurely can occur when
several conditions are met. The conditions are the following:<BR><BR> - the
sound length registers, NR11, NR21 or NR31 - bits 0~6 are non-zero<BR>- the
continuous bit of sound registers NR14, NR24 or NR34 is set to 0 (continuous)<BR>-
and the initial bit of sound registers NR14, NR24 or NR34 is changed from 1 to 0
while the upper frequency is incremented or decremented.<BR><BR>This problem
seems to be dependent on the value in the sound length registers, NR11, NR21 or
NR31 - bits 0~6.  The larger the value, the sooner it stops.<BR><BR>To get
around this sound bug, set the duration again after the frequency high byte.

<HR>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="SpriteSize">What size sprites does the GB support ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>8 x 8 or 8 x 16 pixels. If you use 8 x 16 size sprites then you can
only have an even sprite number. (i.e. First sprite number = 0, second sprite
number = 2, third sprite number = 4, ...) The lowest bit of the sprite number in
8 x 16 sprite mode is always 0 no matter what. (i.e. Selecting sprite number 3
gives you sprite number 2 instead.) <BR><BR>Several sprites side-by-side can
be used to display a larger, virtual sprite. Several sprites on top of each
other can be used to add more colo(u)rs to a sprite.<BR><BR>There are 40
sprites total available regardless of whether you are in 8 x 8 or 8 x 16 sprite
mode.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="SpriteMix">Can 8 x 8 sprites &amp; 8 x 16 sprites be
used at the same time ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Possibly so if you use the LYC interrupt carefully but you can't mix
different sized sprites on the same line. Unless you really know what you're
doing the answer is probably no to this question.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="SpriteLimit">What happens if you exceed the GBs limit of
10 sprites per line ? </A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>When you exceed 10 sprites per horizontal pixel line, only the sprites
with the highest priorities will completely appear in that pixel line. (Sprite
#0 has highest priority, sprite #1 next highest, etc.) The other sprites will
partially or totally disappear (depending on how many of lines of each sprite
break the 10 sprites-per-line limit.)<BR><BR>If you plan to have more than 10
sprites that at some time will share the same lines, then continuously alternate
some of the sprite priorities with each vblank. This will cause them to blink
annoyingly (but only when the 10 sprites-per-line limit is exceeded) but this is
often better then them disappearing partially or completely.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="SpriteBetween">Can you have a sprite appear above the
background but below the window ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>On the GBC, yes. You might can do it on the other GBs as well but only
with creative use of the LYC interrupt.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="SpritePri">What happens if you have one sprite appear
above the background and another sprite with higher priority appear below the
background ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>In the case where two sprites such as these overlap, the sprite above
the background will take on the colo(u)rs of the background pixels directly
under it.<BR><BR>Some have said that the Amiga has a similar response under
these conditions.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="SpriteImp">Software-wise, how do most games implement
sprites ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Sprite RAM is located from $fe00-$febf. You can write directly to
sprite RAM to modify the sprite attribute table but you should only do this
during V-blank for reliability.<BR><BR>Most commercial games don't write
directly to sprite RAM. Instead, they use sprite DMA ($ff46). You can just setup
a sprite attribute table that is 256 byte aligned ($xx00), in RAM for instance,
and then use sprite DMA to transfer this table to sprite RAM. Often, sprite DMA
is put at the start of a V-blank interrupt. As a result, your sprite attribute
table is copied to sprite RAM automatically each V-blank.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="SpriteBug">What precautions should I use when writing
assembly code &amp; using sprites ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>If your writing GBC dedicated code then the following info doesn't
apply.<BR><BR>If you are writing GB or GBC compatible assembly code then you
need to make sure that the following instructions don't occur while their double
register values are in the range $fe00-$feff or else sprite RAM will once in a
while get trashed causing sprite flicker &amp; other strange sprite behaviour:<BR><BR><STRONG>inc</STRONG>
xx<BR><STRONG>dec</STRONG> xx<BR><BR>(xx = bc, de, hl, or sp)<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="SpriteDMA"> What precautions should I use when doing
Sprite DMA ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>In order to do a sprite DMA you have to have a sprite table with
address $xx00. (x = don't care) Depending on the address of this sprite table
you have several options:<BR><BR> <STRONG>Sprite table not in video RAM
($8000-$9fff)</STRONG> - Most games do not put their sprite table in video RAM
but rather usually use low RAM ($c000-$dfff). The reason for this is because you
can write to low RAM at any time but video RAM is picky about writes when the
screen is on.<BR><BR>When using sprite DMA ($ff46) with a sprite table that is
not in video RAM, the code which performs this DMA function must be located in
high RAM ($ff80-$fffe) because, except for video RAM, all other memory areas are
disabled. The duration of sprite DMA is ~160 (80 in double speed) microseconds.<BR><BR>In
order to do this you have to copy a small routine to high RAM containing the DMA
command, a small delay loop, and a RET instruction to return to the main routine
that called it. Interrupts MUST be disabled during non-video RAM sprite table
DMAs. Example assembly code (rDMA=$ff46):<BR><BR><PRE><STRONG>; $c000 ~ c09f --&gt; OAM
        ld      a,$c0
        ld      [rDMA],a
        ld      a,40
.loop:
        dec     a
        jr      nz,.loop
        ret</STRONG></PRE><BR><BR><STRONG>Sprite table in video RAM
($8000-$9fff)</STRONG> - If you choose to put your sprite table in video RAM
then you can perform sprite DMA using code in ROM (no need to call high RAM) and
you don't have to wait for DMA completion. Also, interrupts don't have to be
disabled to use sprite DMA in this case. Example assembly code (rDMA=$ff46):<BR><BR><PRE><STRONG>; $9f00 ~ 9f9f --&gt; OAM
        ld      a,$9f
        ld      [rDMA],a</STRONG></PRE><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="SpriteBack"> I have read somewhere someone mentioning &quot;background&quot;
sprites. What are these and how do I use them ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>The terminology &quot;background&quot; sprite is in reference to a
virtual sprite, not a physical sprite. It is a software technique that is used
that makes it appear that you are using sprite hardware but in reality you are
not.<BR><BR>This was a popular technique that was used in such games as Mortal
Kombat 2 in order to draw the actors. It involves writing directly into the
background map. You can even do smooth, single pixel scrolls of &quot;background&quot;
sprites that contain transparent pixels if your code is advanced enough to
handle that.<BR><BR>Since the release of the GBC, this technique is not as
feasible to implement due to limitations of the GBC background colo(u)r
palettes.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="Sprite40"> Is it possible to display more than 40
sprites at one time ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Yes, but it is tricky. Ferrari for GB does this. You have to use an
LYC interrupt to modify the OAM (sprite RAM) while the screen is drawing.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="SpritePri2"> How do sprite priority settings work on the
GBC ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Among sprites themselves, sprite #0 has highest priority, sprite #1
has next highest priority, etc.(i.e. Sprite #0 will always appear over sprite
#1.)<BR><BR>Bit 7 of the sprite attribute flags determines that a sprite will
appear above the background &amp; window if it is 0 and below them both (visible
only through colo(u)r 0 of background &amp; window) if it is 1.<BR><BR>When
bit 7 of bank 1 of tile attribute memory ($9800-$9fff) is set to 1 it will force
the background and/or window to have priority over the sprite attribute flags
and to appear over sprites no matter what the setting of the sprite attribute
flags.<BR><BR>If bit 0 of register LCDC ($ff40) is 0 then sprites will always
appear above the background &amp; window regardless of the settings of sprite
attribute flags &amp; tile attribute memory.<BR><BR><BR></DD></DL>
<HR>
<DL><DT><STRONG><A NAME="Assemblers">What assemblers are available ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>RGBDS, TASM (Table ASseMbler, not Turbo ASseMbler), ADVancedGBIDE,
ISAS, and the assembler which is provided with GBDK. ISAS is only available to
licensed developers. Many people use RGBDS and it is probably the most powerful
assembler available. Quite a few people use TASM due to it's simplicity. For
serious work, though, RGBDS or ISAS are probably the best choices. <BR><BR>Here
are the main differences between the two most popular &amp; easily available
assemblers:<BR><BR><BR><STRONG>TASM Advantages:</STRONG>
<BR><BR>* Allows quick development for short programs because it's a &quot;simple&quot;
compiler with linker built in.<BR><BR>* Supports 0xh (hex) &amp; 0xb (binary)
formats preferred by some that don't like using $x for hex &amp; %x for binary
numbers.<BR><BR>* Has a nice listing output for the compiler results.<BR><BR>*
Allows using '[]' or '()' to reference memory. (If you are using the latest TASM
table...)<BR><BR><BR> 
<STRONG>RGBASM Advantages:</STRONG><BR><BR>* Allows development of GameBoy
programs up to 4Mbytes in size. To develop a ROM larger    than 32kbytes in size
using TASM you have to paste files together using DOS &quot;copy /b f1+f2 f3&quot;
   or something similar. If you plan on calling code in 2 or more different ROM
banks you have to assemble these files separately and manually make sure that
CALLs or JPs to these banks are valid as the assembler is incapable of catching
errors in this case.<BR><BR>   * Allows including all or part of a raw binary
data file into your program. Often this means data such as a tileset, tile map,
etc. To do this with TASM you have to convert the binary data to the format
.byte $xx,$xx,$xx,$xx,.... using a program such as 'dump' by Jens Ch.
Restemeier.<BR><BR>   * Has a macro language which blows tasm away. Period.<BR><BR>
  * Automatically optimizes 'LD' instructions. A 'LD' from $ff00-$ffff takes two
bytes. A 'LD' from    the rest of memory takes three bytes. TASM isn't capable
enough to auto-optimize.<BR><BR>   * Allows local labels between standard
labels:<BR><BR><PRE><STRONG>Test1:
        ld      a,[x]
.loop:
        dec     a
        jr      nz,.loop

Test2:
        ld      a,[x]
.loop:
        dec     a
        jr      nz,.loop</STRONG></PRE><BR><BR>(Local labels start with .) You
can not do this with TASM. Local labels are very helpful in large code projects.<BR><BR>
  * Has a compiler directive BANK(x) that returns the bank number in which label
'x' resides. As a    result, it is easy to build a macro such as 'lcall x' that
does a call from bank-to-bank and you don't have to specifically state which
bank you wish to call. (The macro will figure this out for you by using
BANK(x).) With TASM you'd have to do something like 'lcall 5,x' in which you
specify the bank and the address in the bank you wish to CALL.<BR><BR>* Uses
an Assembler / Linker setup so you can use Borland or GNU MAKE. Therefore don't
have to recompile your whole project when making a minor change.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
