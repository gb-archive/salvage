0.0 INTRODUCTION 

0.1 Overview 

This document is mainly for upcoming (color)Gameboy coders 
who use Pascal Felber´s excellent GBDK package. 

A basic knowledge of the C programming language will greatly 
help you understand how to program for the gameboy using GBDK. 

GBDK has almost no documentation about it´s internal functions 
regarding graphics, interrupts and other important things. 
This document tries to give you an quick overview about all 
GBDK-functions and explains some ColorGameboy specific details.

1.0 Important Notes 

The Gameboy Uses an LCD display with a resolution of 
160x144. The supported sprites are 8x8 and 8x16. There 
is no way to use 32x32 sprites, so don't ask. The 
gameboy supports a max of 40 sprites with 10 on one 
horizontal axis at one time. 

Before writing any data to the videomem you have to disable 
the LCD-Display (display_off();). 

On a real gameboy you are not able to upload data to the 
videomem while the LCD is processing. 
Gameboy emulators may not suffer from this problem. 

If your programm needs to write to the videomem while displaying 
something you have to be in the Vertical-Blank.It´s also possible 
to write data to the videomem while being in the Horizontal-Blank 
but this needs a special interrupt handling. 

Also have in mind that most emulaotrs will fill all 
RAM/ROM with zeros. A real gameboy won´t do that. At the end of 
all programs, it is a good habit to fill at least the visible 
screen data to all 0s. 

All of the information provided is compiled from various 
sources and own experiences. This document is for educational 
purposes and ´homebrew´ GB-development. 

GameBoy and CGB is copyrighted by Nintendo Co., LTD. 

1.1 Background 

void hide_bkg(); // Disable background 

Calling hide_bkg(); turns all the background tiles off. The sprites are still visible. This command does not work with no$gmb.
  

void show_bkg(); // Enable Background 

Calling show_bkg()/SHOW_BKG; turns all the background tiles. This is used to 
turn them on after using the hide_bkg(); 

* Note : On the Gameboy Color, the background tiles start automatically, 
however, on the gameboy and gameboy pocket, they initially start 
off, so call a SHOW_BKG; after you load your background data. 
  

void scroll_bkg(int x, int y); // Scroll background x/y >=0 <=255 
  

void set_bkg_data(int first_tile, int nb_tiles, unsigned char *data); 
/* -128 <= first_tile <= 127 * -128 <= first_tile+nb_tiles <= 127 * nb_tiles >= 1 */ 

set_bkg_data is used to load the background tiles and palette information into 
memory. first_tile is the first tile that you want to load data into, usually 0. 
nb_tiles is the number of tiles you want to load into memory. *data is a pointer 
to the unsigned char that the tiles are stored in. 
  

void set_bkg_tiles(int x, int y, int w, int h, unsigned char *tilelist); 
/* 0 <= x <= 31 * 0 <= y <= 31 * 1 <= w <= 32-x * 1 <= h <= 32-y */ 
set_bkg_tiles puts the tile data onto the screen. You must load the tiles into 
memory using set_bkg_data first. x is the starting location in tiles (pixels / 8) 
to load the data into. y is the starting location in tiles (pixels / 8) to load the 
data into. w is the width of the data you want to load in tiles. h is the height 
in tiles of the data you want to put on the screen. *tilelist is a pointer to 
an unsigned char that has a tile map of what you want to be displayed. 
  

1.2 Color Gameboy Support 

* Note: Before you can set the color attributes for a tile 
you have to switch to the 2nd video-memory bank (VBK_REG=1). 
The CGB can now address upto 512 tiles 
(by use of BIT 3 from the attribute byte) 
  

The attribute byte looks like this: 

BIT 0-2: Palettenumber (0-7) 
BIT 3 : Character Bank select 
BIT 5 : Flip Tile Horizontal 
BIT 6 : Flip Tile Vertical 
BIT 7 : Background Priority 
  

VBK_REG = 1; /* Use this before setting tile-attributes */ 
VBK_REG = 0; /* Use this before setting tile-offsets */ 
VBK_REG sets the Video Bank Register. When set to zero, it loads the 
tile data into the background. When set to one, it loads the palette 
data into the background. You're supposed to set the palette data 
before you set the tile data. 
  

void set_bkg_palette(UBYTE first_palette,UBYTE nb_palettes,UWORD *rgb_data); 

set_bkg_palette loads the palette data into memory so the gameboy color 
can access it. first_palette is the first palette to be loaded. nb_palettes 
is the number of palettes to load. *rgb_data is a pointer to where the 
palette data is located. 
* Note : Never forget to set all 8 palettes after another 
It´s not safe to set individual palettes 
* Note/Plug : Jason's Colors.h has the most common colors predefined for use 
with gbdk projects. 
  

void set_sprite_palette(UBYTE first_palette,UBYTE nb_palettes,UWORD *rgb_data); 

set_sprite_palette loads the sprite palette into memory so the gameboy color 
can access it. first_palette is the first palette to be loaded. nb_palettes 
is the number of palettes to load. *rgb_data is a pointer to where the 
palette data is located. 
* Note : Never forget to set all 8 palettes after another 
It´s not safe to set individual palettes 
* Note/Plug : Jason's Colors.h has the most common colors predefined for use 
with gbdk projects. 
  

/* GB type (GB, PGB, CGB) */ 
/* Read this byte to determine the type of Gameboy*/ 

extern UBYTE _cpu; 

#define DMG_TYPE 0x01 /* Original GB or Super GB */ 
#define MGB_TYPE 0xFF /* Pocket GB or Super GB 2 */ 
#define CGB_TYPE 0x11 /* Color GB */ 

So if you want to be backwards compatible to the normal gameboy use this: 

if(_cpu == 0x11) { 
color-related material 
} 

where 0x11 can also be replaced with CGB_TYPE.
  

1.3 Display 

void display_on(); 
display_on() turns the display on. 

void display_off(); 
display_off() turns the display off. 
  

1.4 Display Modes 

void mode(int m); 

**mode defines** 

M_TEXT_OUT 
M_DRAWING 
M_TEXT_INOUT 

These modes are used for the GBDK built in libraries. M_TEXT_OUT allows puts 
and other text-oriented tools to be used. M_DRAWING allows GBDK's plot 
and other routines (such as directy.h downloadable from Jason's site) 
to be used. M_TEXT_INOUT allows for puts and gets to be used. 
  

1.5 Sprites 

void show_sprites(); /* Enable Sprites */ 

show_sprites() displays sprites properly configured on the visible screen. 
* Note : Newer GBDK versions support SHOW_SPRITES; 
  

void hide_sprites(); /* Disable Sprites */ 

hide_sprites() makes all sprites not visible. 
  

void sprites8x8(); /* Set Spritesize to 8x8 */ 

Sets the sprites to be eight pixels wide by eight pixels tall. 
* Note : Newer GBDK versions support SPRITES_8x8; 
  

void sprites8x16(); /* Set Spritesize to 8x16 */ 

Sets the sprites to be eight pixels wide by sixteen pixels tall. 
* Note : Newer GBDK versions support SPRITES_8x16; 
  

void set_sprite_data(int first_tile, int nb_tiles, unsigned char *data); 

/* 0 <= first_tile <= 255 * 0 <= first_tile+nb_tiles <= 255 * nb_tiles >= 1 */ 
set_sprite_data loads data into the sprite ram area. By doing this, sprites 
are able to contain the patterns you have designed. first_tile is the first 
tile from the data to be loaded. nb_tiles is the number of tiles that you 
want to be loaded. *data is a pointer to an unsigned char that contains the 
tile data you want to be loaded. 
  

void set_sprite_tile(int nb, int tile); /* 0 <= nb <= 39 * 0 <= tile <= 255 */ 

set_sprite_tile configures sprites so that they can be visible by loading 
the sprite tile into the selected sprite. nb refers to which of the 40 visible 
sprites you would like to load data into. tile is an integer refering to which 
tile from the loaded data set in set_sprite_data you want to be accessed by 
the sprite. 
  

void set_sprite_prop(int nb, int prop); /* 0 <= nb <= 39 */ 

** sprite propperties (use with set_sprite_prop) ** 
S_PALETTE 
S_FLIPX 
S_FLIPY 
S_PRIORITY 
set_sprite_prop sets properties for each sprite. S_PALETTE (gameboy color 
only) contains the palette information. S_FLIPX allows the x-axis to be 
flipped/mirrored. S_FLIPY allows the y-axis to be flipped/mirrored. S_PRIORITY 
contains data referring to if this tile should be on top of other tiles or not. 

void move_sprite(int nb, int x, int y); 

/* 0 <= nb <= 39 * 0 <= x <= 255 * 0 <= y <= 255 */ 
move_sprite moves the specified sprite to another x-y location. nb is the number of 
the sprite (0-39) that you would like to move. x is the new x-location for the sprite. 
y is the new y-location for the sprite. 
  

1.6 Window 

void show_window(); 
show_window() displays the window. 

void hide_window(); 
hide_window() hides the window. 

void move_win(UBYTE x,UBYTE y); 
move_win(x,y) moves the window to another location. x is the new x location for the window. 
y is the new y location for the window. 

void scroll_win(BYTE x,BYTE y); /*Move Window relative to current position*/ 
scroll_win scrolls the window to another location. x is how many pixels horizontally you 
would like to scroll the window. y is how many pixels vertically you would like to 
scroll the window. 
  

2. Miscellaneous 

2.1 Interrupts 

Note: Use disable_interrupts() before setting new interrupts. 

void enable_interrupts(); 
enable_interrupts() sets the interrupts to active. Using this allows routines 
set for interrupts to be called. 

void disable_interrupts(); 
disable_interrupts() disables the interrupts. Many routines use disabled interrupts to 
perform their tasks. 

void add_VBL(int_handler h); 
While interrupts are disabled, add_VBL(h) allows routines to be run when the 
vblank interrupt flag is called. h is the routine to perform. 

void add_LCD(int_handler h); 
While interrupts are disabled, add_VBL(h) allows routines to be run when the 
lcd interrupt flag is called. h is the routine to perform. 

void add_TIM(int_handler h); 
While interrupts are disabled, add_VBL(h) allows routines to be run when the 
timer interrupt flag is called. h is the routine to perform. 

void add_SIO(int_handler h); 
While interrupts are disabled, add_VBL(h) allows routines to be run when the 
serial input/output interrupt flag is called. h is the routine to perform. 

void add_JOY(int_handler h); 
While interrupts are disabled, add_VBL(h) allows routines to be run when the 
joystick interrupt flag is called. h is the routine to perform. 

set_interrupts(UBYTE flags); 
Interrupt-Flags 
VBL_IFLAG 
LCD_IFLAG 
TIM_IFLAG 
SIO_IFLAG 
JOY_IFLAG 
set_interrupts(flags) specifies which interrupts to call. 
* Note : (Use "|" to combine them) 
* Mote : VBL_IFLAG should always be set. 
  

2.2 Joypad 

**Joypad defines** 

J_START = Start button 
J_SELECT = Select button 
J_B = B 
J_A = A 
J_DOWN = Down arrow on joypad 
J_UP = Up arrow on joypad 
J_LEFT = Left arrow on joypad 
J_RIGHT = Right arrow on joypad 

int joypad(); 
joypad() returns a byte containing which buttons from the joypad defines are pressed 

int waitpad(int mask); 
waitpad(mask) stops executing the program until the button(s) specified in mask are pressed. 

void waitpadup(); 
waitpadup() stops executing the program until all buttons on the pad are released. 
  

example: 

int i,x,y; 

i = joypad(); 
if(i & J_START) pause(); 
if(i & J_UP) y--; 
if(i & J_DOWN) y++; 
if(i & J_LEFT) x--; 
if(i & J_RIGHT) x++; 
  

3. Memory 

3.1 Banks 


GBDK doesn´t supports Memory-BANKS automatically. 
You have to link them with the compiler. GBDK i.e. can´t 
split huge data into several roms. You have to 
handle the BANKS yourself with direct memory adressing. 

The best way of handling BANKs is to put all your 
program-code into BANK(0) and your data-code into BANK (1-31). 
  
  

Using the MBC1 memory bank controller 
------------------------------------- 
#define SWITCH_ROM_MBC1(b) \*(unsigned char *)0x2000 = (b) 
SWITCH_ROM_MBC1(b) switches the current changable 16k ROM to the bank specified by b. 

#define SWITCH_RAM_MBC1(b) \*(unsigned char *)0x4000 = (b) 
SWITCH_RAM_MBC1(b) switches the RAM bank to the bank specified by b. 

#define ENABLE_RAM_MBC1 \*(unsigned char *)0x0000 = 0x0A 
ENABLE_RAM_MBC1 enables support for external ram. 

#define DISABLE_RAM_MBC1 \*(unsigned char *)0x0000 = 0x00 
DISABLE_RAM_MBC1 disables support for external ram. 

Using the MBC5 memory bank controller 
------------------------------------- 

Note! Using MBC5 and bankswitching seems to have a slight error in the code. 

#define SWITCH_ROM_MBC5(b) 
\*(unsigned char *)0x2000 = (b)&0xFF; \*(unsigned char *)0x3000 = (b)>>8 
SWITCH_ROM_MBC5(b) switches the current changable 16k ROM to the bank specified by b. 

#define SWITCH_RAM_MBC5(b) \*(unsigned char *)0x4000 = (b) 
SWITCH_RAM_MBC5(b) switches the RAM bank to the bank specified by b. 

#define ENABLE_RAM_MBC5 \*(unsigned char *)0x0000 = 0x0A 
ENABLE_RAM_MBC1 enables support for external ram. 

#define DISABLE_RAM_MBC5 \*(unsigned char *)0x0000 = 0x00 
DISABLE_RAM_MBC1 disables support for external ram. 

void hiramcpy(UBYTE dst,const void *src,UBYTE n); 
hiramcpy copies procedures from ROM to RAM. 
  

3.2 How to include binary data-banks to your ROM image 

If you want to include binary code into your program 
you can use the following procedure. 

- Compile a standard 32KB ROM Image 
- Set BYTE 0x147 to 1 (ROM+MBC1) 
- Set BYTE 0x148 to your used romsize 
- Add your 16KB Binaryfile to that image 
  (i.e. on MS-DOS systems simply use COPY /b main.gb + bank01.gb final.gb) 
  

0 - 256Kbit = 32KByte = 2 banks 
1 - 512Kbit = 64KByte = 4 banks 
2 - 1Mbit = 128KByte = 8 banks 
3 - 2Mbit = 256KByte = 16 banks 
4 - 4Mbit = 512KByte = 32 banks 
5 - 8Mbit = 1MByte = 64 banks 
6 - 16Mbit = 2MByte = 128 banks 

52 - 9Mbit = 1.1MByte = 72 banks 
53 - 10Mbit = 1.2MByte = 80 banks 
54 - 12Mbit = 1.5MByte = 96 banks 
  

- Finally use RGBFIX95 to pad your file and  fix all the other stuff. 

For accessing this (extern) data from C you can use this method: 

UBYTE *data,externdata; 
data=(UBYTE*)0x4000; 

SWITCH_ROM_MBC1(2)  // Switch to ROM Bank 2 
externdata=*data;                       // Here you already access BANK 2 
SWITCH_ROM_MBC1(1) // Switch back to ROM Bank 1 
  

4. Color Gameboy Programming Info: 

4.1 How to set your ROM to CGB-Mode 

- Write 0x80 to rombyte-offset 0x143 (=CGB mode) 
   ( you can do this at link-time by setting this linkerswitch: Wl-yp0x143=0x80) 

Without setting this byte most emulators will treat your program wrong (and of course the real CGB too). 

0xC0 is supposed to be used for GBC-only roms, however most emulators currently do not support, this, so you can use the
if(_cpu == 0x11) to make sure the game runs in color-only mode.
  

4.2 How to write real CGB comaptible Code 

For being compatible to the real Gameboy you should use this order when coding: 

- Disable LCD, Disable Interrupts (see 1.3 and 2.1) 
- Identify if the Gameboy you are currently running on is a CGB (see 1.2) 
- Transfer color palettes (see 1.2) 
- Transfer VRAM (video-memory) (see 1.1) 
- Transfer attributes to Bank1 (see 1.1 and 1.2) 
- Transfer tilesoffsets to Bank0 (BF CHR Code Transfer) (see 1.1) 
- Enable LCD Display (see 1.3) 
- Go on with your normal code....
