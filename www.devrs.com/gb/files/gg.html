<P>The Game Genie is designed to replace Cartridge ROM bytes with user entered
values. It doesn't actually modify the information in the Cartridges themselves.
GameBoy Games just ACT like the ROM has been modified.</P>
<P>This is the format for Game Genie codes for GameBoy:</P>
<TABLE BORDER="1"><TR><TD COLSTART="1" VALIGN="MIDDLE"><H2>DD</H2></TD><TD
COLSTART="2" VALIGN="MIDDLE"><H2>2-103</H2></TD><TD
COLSTART="3" VALIGN="MIDDLE"><H2>-ACB</H2></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSTART="1">Replace
Value</TD><TD COLSTART="2">Address</TD><TD COLSTART="3">Compare Value</TD>
</TR>     

</TABLE>
<P>Late model Game Genies only require you to enter the first six digits. All
nine digits are required for selecting a specific rom bank.</P>
<P>The DD above is the Replace Value. AB above is the old byte value in ROM to
be replaced. Since there are different ways of selecting rom banks, the only way
for the Game Genie to determine which byte to replace in which ROM bank is by
comparing what's in ROM to the Compare Value. If these match up, then the
replace value is put on the data bus. Otherwise the old ROM data is presented to
the GameBoy.</P>
<P>The AB compare value is encoded. To restore it's original value invert AB
(xor $ff), rotate value right by 2, then invert bits 0, 2 and 6 (xor $45).</P>
<P>The C value above is still undetermined but if you XOR it with encoded
nibble A the result must not be any of the values 1 through 7 or else you will
receive a bad code message. Usually this value will be 8 when decoded.</P>
<P>The Game Genie can only modify/replace ROM addresses 0002 to 7FFF. The most
significant nibble in the address (3 above) is complemented. (i.e. it is entered
as a complemented value.) ( Values:0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 --&gt; Complement
equivalent:F,E,D,C,B,A,9,8) Values of 0 - 7 are not allowed for the most
significant nibble as these are above memory locations 7FFF.</P>
<P>From my testing I've concluded that six digit codes affect every ROM bank.
(i.e. a code that affects address 7000 will also affect virtual addresses 0F000,
17000, 1F000, 27000, etc.). This probably is not a problem for most games since
graphics are usually put in these extra banks &amp; minor 'flaws' introduced
into these banks would probably hardly be noticeable. This WOULD heavily affect
Multi-game cartridges though that may have code in every bank.</P>
