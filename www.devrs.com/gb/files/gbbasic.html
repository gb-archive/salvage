<PRE><STRONG>What is GB Basic?</STRONG>

 GB Basic is a floating-point BASIC interpreter for GameBoy. It allows
you to write BASIC programs up to 7.4K bytes in length and save them in
battery backed RAM.


<STRONG>What's it useful for?</STRONG>

 If you are interested in robotics or electronics projects, then it
could be very useful in controlling an application. It contains a
built-in command for controlling up to 8 servo motors along with
other useful commands.


<STRONG>How do you program it?</STRONG>

 1. Programs can be entered from the built-in controls.
    (Even though this is painfully slow.)

 2. You can program it from your IBM-PC keyboard using the
    GB-to-Parallel Port cable and running GB Terminal for DOS.

 3. You can download a text file from your IBM-PC using the
    GB-to-Parallel Port cable and running GB Terminal for DOS.

 4. You can use the GB tools on Micah Dowty's web page to
    transfer basic programs to the Super Smart Card ram.
    His web page is listed on my 'Other Sites' page.

 5. You can edit programs with <A HREF="http://www.freeflight.com/fms/VGB/">Virtual GameBoy</A>. The &quot;.sav&quot;
    file used by VGB saves basic programs when you use the
    SAVE command in GB Basic. The &quot;.sav&quot; file san be loaded
    into Super Smart Card ram with SMART.EXE.

 6. There is software support for a <A HREF="gbmac512.gif">rewired Mac 512 Keyboard</A>
    that's made from an <A HREF="mac512.gif">unmodified Mac 512 keyboard</A>.


<STRONG>What do I need to use GB Basic?</STRONG>

 You need a <A HREF="smart.html">Super Smart Card</A> that can be bought from <A
HREF="http://www.ncsx.com/">National Console Support</A>
that allows you to copy programs from your IBM-PC to a programmable
cartridge. Or you can buy a GameBoy cartridge such as Donkey Kong or
Metroid II that contains battery backed SRAM &amp; and replace the rom
with an eprom of your own. A list of many cartridges that contain
battery backed SRAM can be found in the <A HREF="faq.html">GameBoy FAQs</A>. It will
also run on <A HREF="http://www.freeflight.com/fms/VGB/">Virtual GameBoy</A>.


<STRONG>Is it free?</STRONG>

GB Basic is distributed as shareware. Which means if you like it and
regularly use it send me $15US. Prolonged use without sending
anything is just plain unethical. (I've spent HOURS on this thing. 8)
