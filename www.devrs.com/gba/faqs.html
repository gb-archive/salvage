<DL><DT><STRONG><A NAME="Anyone">Is anyone allowed to post ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Anyone is allowed to submit a post that will be moderated before being
posted.<BR><BR>In order to do an unmoderated post you have to apply for a
login/password. In general, you need your own related web site with unique
information to get a login/password for access to the area in which you are
interested so that you can post. (i.e. A web site with not much new information
or you choose not to share the source code for your projects may result in an
ignored login/password request.) On that web page you should have some useful
content that is sharing some kind of file or other information that might be
helpful to others using the area.<BR><BR>You can apply for a login/password
from the 'Got info to post?' menu option.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="Post">What topics or information are acceptable for me
to post ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Devrs.Com is meant to be a means for exchanging development-related
announcements. It is NOT meant to be a general-purpose message board for
questions and conversations.<BR><BR>No personal attacks, terribly off-topic
posts, or &quot;bad&quot; language will be tolerated either. Since &quot;bad&quot;
language is basically a vague and subjective issue, just use your best
judgement. Don't post stuff that would be embarassing to show your kids 10 to 15
years from now.<BR><BR>In general, posting is most appropriate for major
updates in tools used for development or code fragments / complete code works
that are novel and related to this area. It is possible that other works will be
randomly rejected for publication due to the intent of this site to continuosly
provide new ideas &amp; content to it's visitors.<BR><BR>Posting job
advertisements to any page requires that you pay a fee of US$10 a month for 3
months minimum. However, you can post the advertisement before sending payment.<BR><BR>Anyone
can lose their account / posting rights at any time and for any reason without
warning. At times this may be an individual decision or a group decision to deny
posting rights.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="Again">I posted something 5 minutes ago to a &quot;What's
New?&quot; page. Can I post again now ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>If you have new information or a totally different software or
hardware package then yes.<BR><BR>If you are announcing a new version of the
same hardware or software package then please wait atleast 3 days as a minimum
between announcements. An exception would be if you found a terribly
<B>serious</B> bug in the previous version. (i.e. The bug will damage a file,
your disk drive, fry components, cause power outages in small cities, etc. ;)
You can always modify your post at any time and for any reason to notify people.
Some people just might not be interested in your announcement for your new
software / hardware gadget upgrade and don't want/need an hourly/daily update on
your changes.<BR><BR>If no new post has been made by anyone else since your
last post to a &quot;What's New?&quot; page then you should modify that post
with your new information rather than posting a new message if at all
feasible/possible.<BR><BR>Repeatedly violating these rules can possibly cause
your posting rights to be revoked.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="Areas">Can I post my news to all areas on Devrs.Com ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>First, you can only post to areas in which you have been allowed
access to post. To get access to posting to a specific area you must have a web
page that is related to that area either on your own web account or on a web
account for which you have been given permission to host your information. On
that web page you should have some useful content that is sharing some kind of
file or other information that might be helpful to others using the area.<BR><BR>Second,
if you think the information would benefit multiple areas then yes.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="Pass">I applied for a login &amp; password but never got
one. Why ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>First, you must have information related to the area you applied for
on a web page.<BR><BR>Second, it really needs to be unique information in
order for you to get a password. If there are several web pages already that
have basically the same information on them then your pages may not be very
unique.<BR><BR>Third, if your web pages use extremely large type, contain more
hype than information, and/or announce what you plan to do rather than what you
have already done then it may be extremely difficult to get a password until you
correct the situation.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="Advert">Can I post an advertisement for a related
commercial product ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Yes, but only once to the &quot;What's New?&quot; page. There are
other pages that are designed for commercial products so that everyone will be
aware of your product.<BR><BR>The exception would be that you are announcing
new features for a software or hardware package.<BR><BR>Announcing special
promotions or discount pricing for a commercial product does not warrant a
unique post to the &quot;What's New?&quot; page. You CAN include this
information on other pages or WITH upgrade announcements on the &quot;What's
New?&quot; page. Or you can modify a previous post on any page to announce
current specials.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="URL">My http://www.devrs.com settings don't work when I
use http://devrs.com. Why ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>This is a cookie/URL related problem. There is no current solution for
this except to go in and set the same settings yourself for both by first using
one URL and then using the other.<BR><BR>Make sure if you ever make any user
configuration changes (&quot;Modify&quot;) that you do so first using one and
then the other URL or else you might get really confused about the current
settings if you randomly use either URL. :)<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="Speed">How do I speed up page loads ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Change the background from the default pattern to a solid color
instead. Use the 'Modify' menu option to do this.<BR><BR><BR></DD>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="Orcad">What schematic software do you use ?</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><BR>Orcad v1.25 from circa 1986. I don't much care for later versions of
Orcad (or others) that implement a &quot;complexicated&quot; (tm ;) border and
title area.<BR><BR><BR></DD></DL></BODY>
