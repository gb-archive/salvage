Cybiko Model Technical Differences
----------------------------------
  by Jeff Frohwein, v1.0124

 There currently are two different cybiko models.
Version 1 has a power switch on the side.
Version 2 uses the Esc key to power up.
Besides this difference, the other main difference
is that you have ~80KBytes more file space for
games on Version 2 units.

 Below are more differences between the two.

 CyOS Boot Loader is the actual boot ROM in the
cybiko itself. It resides in non-upgradeable memory.
The version of Boot Loader that is installed in your
system can be viewed by looking at the SDK Console
window as you power up your cybiko. (Assuming the
cable is in place and the COM port setting is correct.)

 CyOS is the actual operating system that gets loaded
by the Boot Loader. It resides in flash and can be
upgraded.


Version 1
---------
  512KBytes Internal RAM
  512KBytes File Flash
  No CyOS Flash. (comp1.2.XXr.boot stored in file Flash.)
  4KBytes CPU RAM
  32KBytes CPU (BootLoader) ROM
  32Kbits Video RAM (Hitachi HD66421)
  Comes with CyOS Boot Loader v1.1.5 or less.
  Uses CyOS v1.2.xx versions.
  CyWIG uses the file 'CyRS_115.boot' to put the
  base cybiko unit into CyWIG server mode.


Version 2
---------
  256KBytes Internal RAM
  512KBytes File Flash
  256KBytes CyOS Flash (System packs are stored here.)
  4KBytes CPU RAM
  32KBytes CPU (BootLoader) ROM
  32Kbits Video RAM (Hitachi HD66421)
  Has a reset button instead of a power button.
  Comes with CyOS Boot Loader v1.1.6 or greater.
  Uses CyOS v1.3.xx versions.
  CyWIG uses the file 'CyRS_119.boot' to put the
  base cybiko unit into CyWIG server mode.


   Below is example boot information that you can
  view when powering up your cybiko while using SDK Console:
