Based on a study by the [Video Game History Foundation](https://www.vghf.org/), only 13% of video games released prior to 2010 are accessible through first-party markets. It’s even worse for the Game Boy catalog at less than 6%. That doesn’t mean that these games are completely inaccessible, as they may be found through used game stores or online marketplaces like eBay. However, it does mean that these games have a greater chance of being lost completely.

Many organizations and communities are working on and promoting the preservation of video game history. This is a global effort from the likes of the [National Videogame Museum](https://www.nvm.org.uk/) in England and the [Strong National Museum of Play](https://www.museumofplay.org/) in the United States along with decentralized platforms such as the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/). None of these communities seem to put a focus on the niche category of the preservation of homebrew games. It’s hard to blame anyone as preservation efforts already have enormous challenges with archiving games published in the mainstream or with the new challenge of preserving Always Online or Games as a Service titles. It’s truly an uphill battle.

Luckily, there are efforts within these homebrew communities to preserve games as they are created. More specifically in the Game Boy community, there is the Game Boy Development Community’s [Homebrew Hub](https://hh.gbdev.io/). The Homebrew Hub is a collection of Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance homebrew games that are preserved in a database and playable in a browser! I reached out to Antonio Vivace, the project lead of [gbdev.io](https://gbdev.io/) and Homebrew Hub, to talk about the inspirations for starting the project, the challenges they face, and how you can contribute!

### What was the initial spark or circumstances surrounding the start of the project?

Development on Homebrew Hub started in 2017. Its inception was influenced by several factors converging around that time. My growing interest in Game Boy emulators, particularly those capable of running in browsers using JavaScript, coincided with some personal enthusiasm for digital repositories and the preservation of digital artifacts. Observing that the homebrew scene within gbdev.io was quite established but lacked a dedicated platform for archiving and preserving homebrew software, I saw a significant opportunity. Motivated by the need to safeguard these pieces of digital history (and potentially promote new entries), I initiated the Homebrew Hub to systematically archive binaries and metadata of homebrew games and applications, ensuring their accessibility and preservation.

### What would you say the biggest challenge is right now for the preservation of modern homebrew games?

The major challenges are:

1. To build a solid metadata standard that can accommodate the large variety of software that is being produced for retro consoles.

2. Communicate and convince developers to digitally preserve their work and host it on platforms that can expose proper and standardized metadata.

3. Develop interfaces with good UX and easy UIs to allow anyone to submit their entries.

4. Obtain proper metadata and license information about old and new entries.

### This is a community-led effort, so in what way could someone interested in contributing help out?

The best way to contribute to Homebrew Hub is to submit your entry and help our database grow: [https://github.com/gbdev/database](https://github.com/gbdev/database).

If you are a Python or React developer, you can also help with the back end and the front end of the project. More information can be found at [https://gbdev.io/](https://gbdev.io/).

You can also donate to our Open Collective: [https://opencollective.com/gbdev](https://opencollective.com/gbdev) or sponsor us on GitHub: [https://github.com/gbdev](https://github.com/gbdev).

I really appreciate Antonio Vivace for taking the time to respond to some of my questions! You can find more about his contributions on his [GitHub](https://github.com/avivace).

As Antonio said, if you’re a part of the Game Boy development community and you don’t already see your game hosted in the database head over to their GitHub page above to add it! They currently have a collection of over 1300 games so if you’re a game developer or enthusiast, consider contributing to this valuable preservation effort.
